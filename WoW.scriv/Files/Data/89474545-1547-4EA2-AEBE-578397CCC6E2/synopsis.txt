Recalled to the Eastern Kingdoms, the group face the Dark Iron in Searing Gorge, then the black dragon-kin in Burning Steppes. They join Lo'Gosh and Broll Bearmantle in retrieving Marshal Windsor from Blackrock Depths and confronting Onyxia in Stormwind. Onyxia escapes, and the group find a way to enter her lair and kill her.
