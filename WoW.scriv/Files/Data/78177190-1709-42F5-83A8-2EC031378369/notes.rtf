\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 Plugger Spazzring owns and runs the Grim Guzzler, the bar in Blackrock Depths. He has summoned Mistress Nagmara, a Sayaad, to work as his barmaid. Nagmara is unlike many of her kind, and after working at the Grim Guzzler for a long time, she has come to appreciate Plugger as a fair and generous master. She enjoys the work, and has fallen in love with one of their regular customers, Private Rocknot. Unfortunately, the natures of the Sayaad does not permit love - whenever they get close to another, their lust destroys their lover's soul. Nagmara has devised a potion that will protect Rocknot for a short time, and she has had other adventurers bring her most of the ingredients. Now, she only needs some gromsblood and a skilled alchemist to mix it properly. Luckily, Kamery can provide both. Kamery makes the potion, and Nagmara and Rocknot immediately slip out the back door to try it out, leaving the door open behind them.}}
