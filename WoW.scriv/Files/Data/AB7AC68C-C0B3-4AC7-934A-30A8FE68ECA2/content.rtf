\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The evening sun cast a warm glow over Menethil Harbor as Carolyn, Elthas, Bryna, and Kamery gathered at the local inn after a day of adventuring through the Wetlands and Arathi Highlands. The scent of hearty stew and freshly baked bread wafted through the air as the companions found a corner table to relax.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The room buzzed with conversation as locals and travelers alike shared tales of their own adventures. The innkeeper, a stout dwarf with a braided beard, approached their table with a nod of recognition.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 "Back from the wilds, are ye?" he grunted, setting down four tankards of ale. "On the house for the heroes of Menethil!"}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Carolyn raised an appreciative eyebrow. "Heroes might be a bit much, but we do our best."}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Laughter rippled through the group as they clinked tankards together before taking sips of the frothy brew. The evening air outside was cool, and the sound of waves lapping against the harbor provided a soothing backdrop.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 "So, what's the plan for tomorrow?" Elthas asked, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "More orc-slaying, or perhaps a detour through Arathi's haunted lands?"}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Kamery smirked, twirling a dagger between her fingers. "I vote for haunted lands. Maybe we'll stumble upon some buried treasure or an ancient artifact."}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bryna, her red hat slightly askew, chimed in, "As long as it's not cursed, I'm in."}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The conversation flowed effortlessly, blending plans for the next day's adventure with tales of their encounters. As the night wore on, the inn's atmosphere grew livelier, with a bard strumming a tune in the corner and patrons joining in song.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Amidst the camaraderie, the companions found comfort in each other's company, their bond growing stronger with every shared moment of triumph and laughter. The challenges of the Eastern Kingdoms were many, but in the warmth of the inn, they found respite, unity, and the promise of more adventures on the horizon.}}
