She watches Thrall visit occasionally, and on one of those visits, he spots her and flies up to speak with her. Raynn is surprised, until Thrall reveals to her that he hadn't actually lost his memory after the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Thrall gives Raynn an Orcish battle harness, forged from his father's old armor, but enchanted and made to fit her. The two enjoy a quiet moment of togetherness, knowing that they are now both aware of their full history together.}}
