\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 "I must admit, Lily, your world is a marvel, but I find myself missing the simplicity of Azeroth," Anduin confessed, his thoughts drifting to the lands and people he was duty-bound to protect.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Lily patted him on the shoulder, a comforting gesture. "Don't worry, Anduin. We'll figure this out. There has to be someone or something that can send you back to your realm."}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Their search led them to an eccentric inventor who claimed to have expertise in interdimensional travel. The inventor, a wild-haired enthusiast named Dr. Evelyn Sparks, examined Anduin with a mix of excitement and skepticism.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 "And you're really from another world? This is amazing!" Dr. Sparks exclaimed, her eyes widening.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Anduin nodded solemnly. "Indeed. I seek a way to return to Azeroth and fulfill my responsibilities."}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Lily and Anduin assisted Dr. Sparks in assembling a makeshift portal device, Anduin couldn't shake the anticipation building within him. The prospect of returning home, reuniting with his allies, and continuing his mission fueled his determination.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the portal crackled with arcane energy, Anduin exchanged a grateful glance with Lily. With a deep breath, he stepped through, leaving behind the urban landscape of Lily's world for the familiar landscapes of Azeroth. The swirling energies enveloped him, and for a moment, he was suspended between worlds.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then, with a burst of light, Anduin found himself back in Stormwind, the comforting embrace of Azeroth welcoming him home.}}
