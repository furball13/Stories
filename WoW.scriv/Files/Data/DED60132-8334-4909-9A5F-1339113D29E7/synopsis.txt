Elthas exuberantly explores the fields of Westfall as the group makes their way to the Deadmines. Once inside, he and Kamery use stealth to scout; when they are attacked, he uses bear form, and then heals her, impressing her. Kamery picks the lock of the entrance door and they enter. Raynn is taken aback when Carolyn, the healer, joins the melee with her staff. The group faces their first major threat and fights well as a group.
