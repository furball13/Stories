\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Varian\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flashed with determination. \u8220\'93It would be foolish to leave such a powerful weapon in the hands of our enemies,\u8221\'94 he insisted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The argument had drawn Raynn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attention, and she moved closer. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 the warrior acknowledged reluctantly. \u8220\'93Ironfoe is legendary, even in Ironforge.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Kamery frowned beneath her bandanna, but she nodded, accepting defeat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We go cautiously,\u8221\'94 she warned. The warriors both nodded, but she wondered how long that would last.}}
