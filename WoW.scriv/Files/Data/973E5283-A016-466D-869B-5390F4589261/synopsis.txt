Elthas has learned that he can learn a new form if he returns to Darnassus. He seeks out Bryna for a portal, but wants to say goodbye to the others first. They track Carolyn and Kamery down, and meet them outside the Keep. Raynn is at the forge nearby, so they all go there to say their goodbyes. Bryna learns the spell Teleport: Theramore and goes to study with Jaina Proudmoore.
