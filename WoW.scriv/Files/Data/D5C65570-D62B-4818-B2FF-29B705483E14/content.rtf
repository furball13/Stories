\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  The Dun Modr blacksmith's family welcomes two new twin babies, and their house is growing crowded. At the same time, Raynn is feeling confined and bored in the small outpost - she misses traveling with her mother, even if it was only between the internment camps. The dwarves of Dun Modr suggest a solution: to foster Raynn to their Wildhammer cousins in the Hinterlands. Raynn is eager to explore new lands, and the Wildhammers are willing, so Raynn moves to Aerie Peak. She is given a small room of her own in the keep, and begins training to ride the tame gryphons of the Wildhammers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Raynn adapts to life with the Wildhammer dwarves in Aerie Peak. Training as a warrior, she merges her father's teachings with the dwarven style, wearing light leather armor and wielding a dwarven battle hammer. Fluent in orcish and dwarven languages, she becomes part of the Wildhammer dwarves' aerial reconnaissance force.}
