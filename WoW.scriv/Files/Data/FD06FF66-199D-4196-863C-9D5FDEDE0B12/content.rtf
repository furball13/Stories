She begins making her first set of plate armor. When the Deeprun Tram opens, she often travels back to Ironforge for odd jobs, feeling more comfortable with the dwarves. Her first few jobs for humans were for nobles, and she found their attitudes unpleasant, especially considering the cordial reception she gets from Magni. She gets along well with Dane and her warrior trainers.}}
