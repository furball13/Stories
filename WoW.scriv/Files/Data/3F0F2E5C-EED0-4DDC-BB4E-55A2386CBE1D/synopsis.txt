- Jaina promises to continue investigating through magical means
- Bryna and Kamery portal back to Stormwind to report to Shaw (Bryna goes in hopes that Kamery can return with them)
- Varian is back, having been ransomed by the naga
- Shaw dismisses them, telling Kamery to continue building her skills, but also continue building their group dynamic (he is disappointed that Raynn is no longer around though)
