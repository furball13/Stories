\pard\plain \sa240\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Jaina reveals that she has found the spell responsible for splitting Varian into two people, emphasizing that the Varian in Stormwind is not an "impostor" but a genuine part of Varian. (}{\f2\fs20\b0\i0 Onyxia greatly gained influence over Varian after his wife's death but periodically lost control as Varian's attachment to Anduin grew. Thus she attempted to reassert her control by using a spell that would not kill Varian but would remove and destroy his conscience, will, and responsibility.)}}
