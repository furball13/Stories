The group splits again, with Carolyn and Elthas traveling down the western coast of Kalimdor, then across the continent. Kamery is sent on an assignment to the Badlands, then Shaw tells her to find her sister again. Bryna teleports around looking for information on magical memory loss. Raynn continues blacksmithing. They eventually all converge in Tanaris, assist the Bronze Dragonflight by going to Durnholde in the Caverns of Time, and spend some time bonding in Un'goro Crater.
