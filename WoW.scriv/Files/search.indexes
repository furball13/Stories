            <Synopsis>- Kamery comforts Carolyn
- Leads way outside
- Aden tells them he sent Elthas to Sentry Point</Synopsis>
            <Text>On Carolyn’s other side, Kamery gave her sister’s hand another comforting, and apologetic, squeeze, as the rogue continued to process the effect that the Shadow magic had had on the priestess. When she had suggested it, she had thought it just another interrogation technique, but now, she realized, it had been much more for Carolyn.
Carolyn had seemed to take their previous adventures, even the matter with Lescovar, in stride so easily; Kamery had been pleased to see her sister sharing in her way of life. But, she realized, walking in the shadows as she did was far different from actually drawing on the power of Shadow to touch another mind.
Her mind continuing to adjust and adapt, Kamery turned her attention to her sister. Carolyn was relaxing somewhat, now that Hendel was gone, but a complete change of scenery would do her good. It would do them all good, she decided, to get some fresh air.
“Let’s head outside,” she suggested, glancing at Jaina for confirmation. “If we’re not needed here any longer?”
Jaina nodded. “I think we’ve done all we can for now. I will contact you if we have any new information. Until then, please, enjoy Theramore and I invite you to stay as long as you like within our city’s walls.”
With Bryna leading the way, the sisters made their way down the spiraling wooden ramps that led down the height of the tower. The ramps twisted and intertwined in an uneven pattern and platforms at various levels held study or work areas. Mages occupied many of those, reading magical tomes or deep in conversation about various techniques of enchantment.
As they descended, Carolyn worked her hand free from Kamery’s grip to grasp the narrow railing that edged the ramps in most, but not all, places. She looked over at her sister with a familiar reassuring smile and Kamery relaxed. Her sister was returning to normal, and now Kamery knew not to ask her to use Shadow magic anymore.
The final level of the ramp was solid stone, and led directly to the main entrance to the tower. Exiting into the afternoon sunshine, Kamery took a deep breath. They had been in the stone tower for hours, and while she usually didn’t find buildings oppressive, the nature of the interrogation had been intense. It feels good to be outside again. Is this how Elthas always feels?
As if thoughts of the druid had triggered something, her thoughts were interrupted by the deep voice of the mounted guard watching the gate.
“Lady Hawthorne,” the man addressed Bryna, “I recently sent a druid north to investigate rumors from Sentry Point. I believe he was a friend of yours. He asked me to inform you of his whereabouts.”</Text>

            <Title>Un'Goro Crater</Title>
            <Text>Several hours of undulating sand dunes later, they reached the cliffs overlooking Un’goro Crater. Pausing briefly to look out over the canopy of treetops forming a leafy ocean stretching into the haze in the distance, the group then began their descent into the shaded depths.
As they descended the winding path that led down into the lush green crater, the dry heat of Tanaris quickly yielded to the cooler, damper air of the jungle crater. Elthas’s whiskers twitched as he adjusted to the change, noting the rich variety of smells, both familiar and new. They were surrounded by sounds too, and his ears swiveled constantly, trying to identify and locate the various growls and chirps and clicks. He couldn’t wait to explore and find out what they all were.
At the base of the path, they found a small encampment, occupied by a Tauren hunter, his grey-furred body clothed in a mail vest and leggings, with a rough battle axe strapped to his back. As Tauren were members of the Horde, and one of the most formidable races on Azeroth, they approached warily, but the Tauren greeted them warmly in the Common tongue.
He introduced himself as Torwa Pathfinder, and seemed of similar mindset to Bryna, immediately speaking of the rich resources to be found in the crater. Elthas’s ears perked up at the mention of rare hides, although the hunter warned them of the dangers of the crater and its creatures. Furthermore, he told them of a Human expedition that had settled into the northern part of the crater with their guard force of Goblins.
Liking the sound of a relatively safe campsite, they thanked the Tauren and turned north, following the soaring grey granite walls of the crater. Raynn was delighted to find several easily-accessible veins of ore along their way, so it was late evening by the time they arrived at their destination.
The encampment, the refuge of the Marshal expedition, was build on a series of plateaus leading up to and past a cave partway up the cliff-side. The lower ledges near the cave held several tents and lean-tos, occupied by a few Humans. Although rough-looking Goblins guarded the narrow, steep path, they allowed the group to pass without incident, directing them to the Human siblings who led the expedition.
Williden Marshal and his sister Hol’anyee were welcoming, apologizing for the rough conditions; their expedition had run into trouble when they had first arrived and they had lost many of their supplies. However, the brother and sister invited them to settle in to any free space, so they found a good-sized ledge near the top of the accessible area and made their camp.
Although they were still well below the foliage of the massive trees that dominated the lush crater, the air was cooler and drier. From their vantage point, they could look down over the primordial tar-pits directly below the refuge; thankfully, they were high enough that the sulfuric odors didn’t reach them.
Settling their bedrolls at the back of the ledge, they built a small fire-pit closer to the fern-lined edge of the cliff. After a short disagreement over who would sleep where, Elthas found himself comfortably positioned between Carolyn and Bryna, with Kamery and Raynn taking the more vulnerable outer places.</Text>

            <Title>Playing the AH</Title>
            <Text>With a smile, Kamery agreed with the statement, simple but carrying so much meaning. “I’ll find you when Shaw is done with me,” she promised.
A short while later, Kamery watched with bemusement as Bryna cast another portal spell. At least half a dozen portals shimmered in the shadowy depths of the ravine. The mage collected another toll, and a young Gnome warlock leaped through the latest portal, this one displaying a shimmering image of the solid stone gates of Ironforge.
After Bryna had cast her first spell, summoning the portal to Darnassus for Carolyn and Elthas, the mage had been beset by travelers seeking a quick escape from this far-flung place. She had named her price with practiced alacrity, and word had apparently spread quickly through the area. Kamery shook her head; she hadn’t realized there were quite so many adventurers in the highlands.
Bryna seemed to have exhausted her customer base for now though, so Kamery approached, her eyes searching for the portal to Stormwind.
“Over here,” Bryna pointed to the correct portal, and Kamery recognized Stormwind’s soaring white stone buildings. It would be good to go home for a while, she realized, even as she knew it likely wouldn’t be for long. Together, the two stepped through the portal.
As the magical kaleidescope of sensations faded, Kamery blinked in the dim light of the interior of Stormwind’s Mage Tower. Studying mages looked up at her, taking in her black leather and bandanna-covered face without a hint of surprise. Given how numerous, and how varied, Bryna’s recent customers had been, Kamery supposed that mages the world over must be used to strangers passing through their portal hubs frequently.
The rogue followed Bryna out of the room and down a short stone ramp. A open doorway at the bottom led outdoors, to a ramp that spiraled down around the outside of the Tower. From the top, it commanded a good view across the purple-tiled rooftops of the Mage District. There were no railings, but Kamery was confident in her sense of balance as she followed the mage down.
After one turn around the Tower, Bryna paused at the edge of the ramp. They were still high above the ground, but no longer dangerously so, and an opening in the buildings below seemed to lead to an easy exit from the twisting turns of the district.
“Jump?” The mage asked, a twinkle in her eye.
Kamery judged the distance, and nodded. She knew that she could tumble as she landed to avoid hurting herself, but she was curious about Bryna. At her nod though, the mage lightly stepped off the ramp edge, and began to float slowly towards the ground. Slow fall, of course, Kamery thought, as she followed the mage more precipitously.
The grassy path took them out of the Mage District as easily as it had promised, and shortly they were crossing into the Trade District. Bryna paused as they approached the trading hall.
“It won’t take long,” she promised. “It’s on the way.”
The mage’s longing was palpable, and Kamery wondered how much Bryna had collected to sell herself. Shaw would likely send her off somewhere else immediately, so she nodded. “Quickly,” she reinforced. The spy-master’s watchers were everywhere, and he likely already knew they had returned.
Bryna nodded, entering the large building. The interior of the trading hall was one open space, with a raised dais at the front, where the traders worked from behind podiums. Buyers and sellers filled the room, most crowded around the front dais, clamoring for the traders’ attention. One benches in the middle of the room, others sat, waiting for a turn, sorting through items to sell, or admiring new purchases. The room was bright and well-lit, but the incessant chatter and sheer number of people overwhelmed Kamery.
Bryna made her way through the crowds with practiced ease. Approaching the podiums at the front, she nodded to the middle-aged man standing behind one. Her red hat drew his attention, and he turned to her, his shoulder-length black hair brushing the shoulders of the blue vest that seemed to be the uniform of the trade facilitators.
“Bryna, welcome back,” the man greeted her warmly. “What do you have for sale today? Or are you buying?” he asked slyly.
Bryna chuckled. “Selling first, Fitch. My business can wait though. First, how’s the market for kingsblood?” One hand gestured for Kamery to approach with her herb pouch, as she accepted a small ledger from Fitch with the other.
“Market’s still strong.” The trader’s eyes widened as he took in the bulging pouch. “Is that all kingsblood?”
Kamery shook her head. “Not all.” She pulled out the sachet of the herb in question and its pungent aroma drew the attention of several of the other buyers.
“kingsblood?” A nearby paladin in gleaming silver armor asked, approaching. Bryna shooed him away distractedly, her attention still on the ledger, and Fitch frowned.
“Official channels only,” the trader chided.
The paladin subsided, but continued to watch them intently.
Fitch smiled at Kamery. “I think we’ll have no trouble moving this. Name your price.”
“Five gold per twenty,” Bryna responded, handing back the ledger. Kamery blinked at the speed of the mage’s answer.
Beside them, the interested paladin made a small sound of disappointment, but Bryna fixed him with a firm look. “Market price.”
Fitch took Kamery’s herbs and efficiently separated and counted them. A moment later, he handed her an impressively heavy stack of gold coins. “Selling anything else?” His voice held a hopeful note.
Overwhelmed by how quickly the process had gone, and by Bryna’s cool efficiency, Kamery shook her head. Bryna gave her a reassuring smile as they stepped away from the podium.
“It gets easier with practice,” the mage assured Kamery. She cast a longing glance back at Fitch. “You’ll be alright from here?”
Kamery laughed; she could navigate the familiar streets of Stormwind far more easily than this trading business. “Yes.” She patted her now-full gold pouch. “Thank you.” Bryna obviously wanted to stay here, and Kamery realized that she didn’t know when she would see the mage again. “For everything.”
Bryna smiled and nodded her acknowledgment. “It’s been interesting.” Her eyes shone with something Kamery couldn’t quite identify, but it seemed that Bryna considered ‘interesting’ a high compliment. “This isn’t the end.” The mage seemed quite sure of that.
What did she and Shaw talk about while I was training, the last time we were here? Kamery wondered, as her thoughts moved ahead to her upcoming visit to the man. Purpose, and curiosity, quickened her step as she left the trading house, leaving Bryna negotiating with the trader, Fitch.</Text>

            <Title>Anduin in Canada</Title>
            <Text>Anduin Wrynn emerged from the swirling darkness into a realm unlike any he had known. The air buzzed with strange energies, and the scent of exhaust mingled with the crisp freshness of the surrounding pine trees. Before him stood a vast expanse of snow-covered landscape, and the cold hit him like an icy breath.

Anduin's gaze shifted from the unfamiliar surroundings to the people nearby, bundled in heavy coats and hurrying about their daily lives. He felt a disorienting mix of awe and confusion as he observed the modern world unfolding before him.

A passerby, noticing Anduin's perplexed expression and regal attire, approached cautiously. &quot;Hey there, are you okay?&quot; The stranger's breath formed a mist in the chilly air.

Anduin, still adjusting to the abrupt shift, replied with a polite nod. &quot;I am well, thank you. But I find myself in a place unfamiliar to me. Can you tell me where I am?&quot;

The stranger chuckled, assuming Anduin's inquiry was part of a playful act. &quot;You're in Canada, my friend. Must be quite the immersive medieval experience you've got going on.&quot;

Canada? The name meant nothing to Anduin, and the notion of a &quot;medieval experience&quot; only deepened his bewilderment. &quot;Canada,&quot; he repeated, the word feeling foreign on his tongue. &quot;I assure you, kind stranger, this is no act. I am truly lost.&quot;

The passerby's bemused smile shifted to a more sympathetic expression. &quot;Lost, huh? Well, welcome to Canada. If you need any help finding your way, just ask around. People here are friendly.&quot;

Anduin nodded, gratitude in his eyes. &quot;Thank you. Your assistance is most appreciated. May the Light guide me in this unknown land.&quot;

As the stranger continued on their way, Anduin stood alone, contemplating the unfamiliar surroundings. The distant hum of traffic and the muted sounds of a modern world surrounded him. In this moment of solitude, he couldn't help but wonder how he had arrived in this strange place and what awaited him in this uncharted corner of Azeroth's mysterious tapestry.</Text>

            <Title>Westfall Investigations</Title>
            <Synopsis>Kamery investigates the Defias in Westfall, and realizes that she needed help.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In frustration, Kamery threw her dagger at the worn side of the abandoned barn. Her razor sharp blade easily lodged in the decaying wood. She stood still for a moment in the dying light of evening, collecting herself. Stay calm.
After weeks of running messages herself, now she was hunting a messenger. She had heard rumors of the Defias sending important, revealing, documents throughout Westfall, and Stoutmantle had tasked her with finding them. The courier was proving difficult to track down, and the past few days of searching had been a challenge to her patience.
Retrieving her dagger, she mused back over how she had gotten into this situation. It had seemed a simple enough mission at first, to deliver a letter to Sentinel Hill in Westfall. But Gryan Stoutmantle had roped her into the investigation into the Defias Brotherhood activity in the area.
The Defias had once been members of the Stonemasons Guild, who had rebuilt Stormwind after the war. However, after a dispute with the House of Nobles, they had moved to Westfall and taken to criminal activity. Charged with protecting the land for Stormwind, Stoutmantle had his hands full, and readily conscripted anyone he could.
Her message to Stoutmantle had started a chain of delivering messages and talking to shady contacts. Various clues and rumors now pointed to the leader of the Defias being none other than the Stonemason’s leader, Edwin VanCleef himself. But the stubborn paladin wanted proof, before he would commit any of his thinly stretched forces to the matter. Her investigation had taken her from Westfall to Redridge and back. Between the gnolls and murlocs along the roads in less-defended parts, she was exhausted.
On the other hand, Kamery decided, she would rather be running all over Stormwind’s territory than holed up in a tree watching an unmoving stone tower, like poor Amber. She only knew a handful of Shaw’s many other agents, so she had enjoyed being sent to deliver a message to one of them. She grinned, remembering Amber’s grumbling, her lips moving against the bandanna that covered the lower half of her face—black, not Defias red.
The wind picked up, ruffling her short dark hair. She patted it back down, and turned her attention back to the job at hand. The courier had to be somewhere between here and Moonbrook, she was sure. Eyes narrowing in focus, she moved back towards the road, staying in the shadows of the tall grass.
A scuffle of sound, barely distinguishable above the rustle of wind in the dry vegetation alerted Kamery to her quarry first. Her senses heightened, she crouched low, staying perfectly still as a lone figure jogged into sight. Red bandanna, check. Leather mail pouch slung over his shoulder, check.
Moving slowly, she pulled the familiar vials from her belt pouch. One at a time, she coated her daggers with the mixtures. The first, on the dagger in her right hand, was carefully concocted to inflict searing pain with the slightest graze of the blades. On her left dagger, the mixture was more subtle, designed to attack the nerves and slow her opponent’s responses.
Her preparations complete, Kamery gripped her daggers, eying the distance to her approaching target. Her mind flashed back to the warrior she had followed in Elwynn Forest before all this started. Bold and decisive, the woman had charged headlong into battle. Kamery hefted her dagger, considering the throw. But no, she was no warrior. Dressed in lightweight leather, she relied on stealth and agility.
The courier passed her position. Kamery made her move, slipping out of the long evening shadows without a whisper of sound. Her soft leather boots and light step barely left a mark on the packed dirt of the road. She could strike him down right now, she knew.
Perhaps she should, after all the Defias had done to the people of Westfall. Studying him though, she saw that he was young, perhaps even younger than her own nineteen years. Just a boy, caught up in the intrigues of men, likely with no other choice. Welcome to the club. But perhaps, just perhaps, he could find a better way.
Her daggers struck twice in quick succession. The first, she reversed the blade, to strike a precise blow on the back of his head. The second, as he crumpled to the ground, stunned, deftly sliced the leather strap of his mail satchel. The weight of the missives within gave her hope. Surely, among all these documents, Stoutmantle would find something useful.
The boy shook his head, trying to clear it, and he struggled to rise. He managed to half-turn to look at her with dazed eyes. His hand fumbled clumsily for the short sword at his waist.
Kamery crouched beside him, her grey eyes boring into his from above her bandanna. She reached out and pulled his red bandanna off. “Find another job,” she advised.
Confusion wrinkled his brow as she tossed the red bandanna aside. His hand stopped moving. “They burned our farm. They killed my pa. What else am I supposed to do?”
He can’t be more than fourteen. Kamery considered for a moment, thinking of Shaw’s network of street urchins, running errands and reporting the goings-on in Stormwind. I wonder if Stoutmantle needs another set of eyes in Sentinel Hill.
“Come with me then.” She stood, helping the boy to his feet. “I’ll recommend you to Stoutmantle. But if you betray him, you’ll answer to me.” She watched him for a moment, to be sure he understood.
The boy looked her over, his keen eyes taking in her lean form, clad in functional black leather, and the two wicked daggers now at her hips, still gleaming with the recently applied poisons. The movement of his throat as he swallowed told her that he got the message.
Hefting the courier bag over her shoulder, Kamery led the way across the barren, abandoned fields of Westbrook, heading towards Sentinel Hill. She glanced sidelong at the wayward boy, wondering if it was his former home they were crossing now, wondering if she should ask. Carolyn would know what to say to him.
I wonder how she’s doing. Kamery felt a pang of sadness, allowing herself a moment before pushing it away. She knew how much her sister had always wanted to see Darnassus, and how excited she had been at the prospect of furthering her studies under the High Priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind. She was truly happy for Carolyn, but after their parents’ deaths, her twin sister had been all she had left. Well, now I have Shaw. Her inner voice laughed at the idea of anyone being close enough to consider Shaw a friend.
Few words passed between the two as they crossed the darkening plains. Kamery kept her eyes moving, alert for signs of trouble. Beside her, she sensed the boy doing the same.
“What’s your name?” She finally broke the silence, keeping her voice low to not attract unwanted attention. From the lurking Defias to the haywire field mechanisms, Westfall was filled with dangers.
“Loran.” Instinct or imitation kept his voice low as well. Impudently, he added, “what’s yours?”
Kamery considered for a moment, then shrugged. “Kamery.”
They walked in silence for several minutes, both alert, but Loran beginning to relax in her presence. A decaying, but still sturdy, wooden fence marked the end of one property and the beginning of another. Kamery glanced in both directions, uncertain, but Loran confidently turned to their left. Again, Kamery wondered if this had once been his home.
Not far along the length of fence, they came across a section where the upper rails had fallen off of their support post. Loran clambered over the tilted beams, and Kamery followed with an agile leap. As she landed, she caught a glimpse of his admiring look, before he schooled his features to sullen indifference again.
Sentinel Hill stood just ahead now, and Loran’s steps slowed as they drew nearer. “What’s he gonna to do with me?”
Kamery heard the raw emotions in his voice—fear, uncertainty, but also an undercurrent of vulnerability. “I don’t know,” she answered honestly. “I won’t let him hurt you.”
Loran nodded uncertainly. He had to know that he had no choice though. Had to know that the Defias wouldn’t take him back now, having lost the communiques that now hung from Kamery’s shoulder.
Entering the small town, they quickly reached the watchtower. The white stone tower, commanding a strategic view of the surrounding lands, rose above a wide platform surrounding its base. At the top of the wide ramp leading up to the tower entrance, Gryan Stoutmantle stood, surveying the town he was charged with protecting. Noticing their approach, he gave Kamery a penetrating look when he saw the boy with her.
“What’s this now?” Stoutmantle asked, his brow lowering. “Who’s this ragtag?”
Kamery snorted. “After sending me to talk to Wiley, you question the company I keep?”
Stoutmantle accepted that with a wry face.
Kamery continued, “I hoped you could find use for him here. Another set of eyes, or hands.”
Stoutmantle gestured her to one side, fixing the boy in place with a stern look. “He’s Defias, isn’t he?” He kept his voice low, his eyes not leaving Loran.
Kamery nodded, clarifying quickly, “He was a messenger. He’s just a boy. He lost his home, and his family.”
Stoutmantle stood still for a few long moments, his eyes distant. Kamery tried to read his thoughts, but his expressionless face gave her no clues. She thought about his undermanned garrison, and how many farmers had lost their homes and lands. Not all of them had left Westfall. How many had chosen to join the Defias? Had any others returned to a lawful life?
The more she learned about the organization, the more she understood their cause. But even as her understanding grew, her abhorrence of their methods grew just as much. No matter how egregiously they had been treated by the king and nobles, their methods were unjustifiable. Loran was just one more example of that.
The boy stood quietly where they had left him, his eyes taking in the town they were in the center of. Warm, flickering firelight lit the windows of many of the small cottages. The lumber mill loomed large on the outskirts, a darker shadow in the growing shadows of night. The wind carried the scent of smoke and tasty stews. Kamery felt her mouth watering at the thought of a warm dinner, and wondered how long it had been since the boy had eaten a good meal. His ragged clothes hung on his thin frame.
Stoutmantle came to a decision suddenly, walking with long strides back to where Loran waited. Kamery could see the tension in the boy, and the fear in his eyes, although he tried to stand straight and tall.
“You willing to do honest work now?” The gruff commander demanded.
Loran nodded. “What sorta work?” His voice trembled slightly, trepidation still evident. Kamery wondered if Stoutmantle noticed. He wasn’t given to subtleties.
Stoutmantle glanced over at the lumber yard, then towards the town’s small inn. He looked back at the boy. “Heather Lowry could use some help at the inn. Lifting, carrying, maybe learn to cook a bit.” The paladin’s grimace lifted Kamery’s lips beneath her bandanna. She had heard his complaints about the local stew on earlier visits. It wasn’t that the stew was bad, but it seemed to be the only thing that Heather knew how to cook.
Loran managed to perk up and relax all at once. He smiled. “My ma taught me how to make Westfall stew.” The boy faltered slightly at Stoutmantle’s groan. “And liver pie,” he added hopefully.
Stoutmantle grinned at that, clapping the boy on the shoulder. “Excellent! But first, I have another task for you that you may not like so much.”
Loran looked quizzically at the commander, his relief fading slightly. Kamery suspected she knew what was about to come, and tried to give the boy a supportive look.
“Tell us everything you know about the Defias.” Stoutmantle’s voice carried the weight of authority.
Loran deflated at that, but then he drew himself together. Perhaps the thought of a new life gave him strength. Kamery hoped so. “Their main hideout is in Moonbrook. They’ve got operations at all the mines, I think.” He frowned uncertainly.
Kamery raised an eyebrow in curiosity. Stoutmantle was more direct. “What do you mean, you think?”
“Well, I never really saw them. I just left messages. And then there was other messages to pick up.” The boy shrugged helplessly.
“Where in Moonbrook?” Kamery asked. Finding their base of operations would be huge.
“Show her.” Stoutmantle broke in. “Exactly where.”</Text>

            <Title>Carolyn and Elthas vs Feathermoon</Title>
            <Synopsis>Elthas and Carolyn travel to Feathermoon Stronghold and fight naga.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Stop it!” Carolyn grumbled, giving the Naga sorceress a thump with her staff. The Naga hissed in annoyance, but the priestess distraction had slowed her spell-casting. Elthas watched from the shadows, amused. He had chased the Naga’s companion, a warrior, down the beach to finish him off. He had returned to find Carolyn had settled into an almost-comfortable pattern with the sorceress, wherein the two females exchanged blows and healing spells in near equilibrium.
Near equilibrium wasn’t what they were here for though, and Elthas was eager to finish off the Naga threat and move on. Across the narrow straight from Feathermoon Island, the towering trees echoed with the mingled chirps and screeches of a variety of wildlife, and he longed to explore the wilds of Feralas.
The flight from Darnassus had been long—the longest flight they’d been on so far, and the Naga threat hadn’t been as bad as it had sounded. The idea of stretching his limbs running across the wild southern reaches of the continent appealed to him.
Pouncing, he helped Carolyn end the battle swiftly. Her grey eyes danced with amusement as she watched him licking his paw afterwards. “I thought you were going to watch forever,” she accused, and he ducked his head. She was laughing though, as they turned back towards Feathermoon Stronghold, leaving behind them a once-more Naga-free shoreline.
Shifting out of feline form, Elthas walked beside the priestess to broach his idea.
“Feralas is impressive, isn’t it?” he began slowly, gesturing with one hand towards the lush green shoreline visible beyond the curving wooden buildings of the Kaldorei outpost.
Carolyn laughed again, and he realized she knew him too well.
“Very well,” he admitted. “I thought it might be fun to run across the continent. Maybe back to Theramore on the other side?”
He glanced down to see Carolyn’s reaction. Her face was thoughtful, as she distractedly tucked a strand of hair back into the somewhat disheveled twist at the back of her head.
“These Naga had nothing to do with those ones,” she frowned.
Elthas was surprised. “What do you mean?”
“I asked.” Carolyn waved a hand behind them. “From what I’ve heard, Naga gloat, a lot, but she didn’t. She was just confused.”
“Are you sure it wasn’t just your staff that was confusing her?” Elthas teased, but he was impressed. Carolyn had thought to question even the Naga here about the no-longer-missing King of Stormwind? He had thought the matter settled, but it seemed the Humans still had lingering misgivings.
Carolyn gave him a playful swat as they turned to mount the short staircase into the main building of the outpost. A wide balcony overhung the beach, housing the hippogryph perch, and leading to a dock to the small skiff that made regular trips back and forth to the mainland, delivering travelers and supplies. Further back, the building rose up in smooth curves, melding with the trees that it was built against.
They had spent the last two days in one of the rooms upstairs, in between forays along the shore to put down Naga incursions, and now they headed back to their room. He caught an appraising look from one of the Sentinels standing watch at the door and felt himself frowning at her disapproval as they passed inside. Some of the more insular Kaldorei settlements were like that, he reflected, somewhat sadly, thinking of Astranaar, almost a year ago now.
The Sentinels there, his own mother included, had been convinced that he was involved in more than just friendship with his Human companion, and had made it clear that such things were not natural. They were wrong, he knew, on both counts. Carolyn was a wonderful friend, and he hated seeing her judged unfairly.
At least in Darnassus, where there were more visitors of other races, attitudes were more open-minded. He wondered if Carolyn had faced the same silent judgment in Stormwind, but their other Human companions, even her own sister, had accepted him easily, so he decided that likely not.
Their meager belongings packed away once more, the pair headed back down towards the ferry to the mainland, and Elthas hoped, more accepting people. Despite the solid stone construction, Theramore had seemed friendly enough.</Text>

            <Text>Two days later, Bryna stood in front of Haleh as the blue dragon used Drakkisath's blood to repair the amulet that would grant them access to Onyxia's lair.
&quot;The Blue Flight wishes you luck,&quot; the Quel'dorei said, handing the finished amulet to Bryna. It thrummed with magical power, but it was uncomfortable to hold, so she slipped it back into its exclusive pocket in her bags.
With words of gratitude and farewell to Haleh, Bryna pulled the teleportation magic about herself, returning in a familiar swirl of sensations to Theramore, where her friends and others awaited, ready to assail the Black Dragonflight's brood-mother.</Text>

Cautiously skirting the masses of Dark Iron Dwarves in the area, Elthas watched Broll prowling ahead of him. He wondered if the other druid felt as uncomfortable in feline form as Elthas himself did in the ursine form. Broll’s command of the shadows was strong though, and the three passed without notice.</Text>

            <Title>Over Coffee</Title>
            <Text>Lily led Anduin through the chilly Canadian streets to a cozy coffee shop, the scent of freshly brewed coffee enticing them inside. She couldn't shake off the feeling that this was an elaborate prank or an immersive cosplay experience, but Anduin's sincerity intrigued her.

As they settled into a corner booth, Lily studied Anduin, noting the fine details of his elaborate armor and the earnest expression on his face. &quot;So, Anduin, you're really committed to this whole prince thing, huh?&quot;

Anduin nodded, his blue eyes meeting hers. &quot;It is not a charade, Lily. I am truly the Prince of Stormwind in my world, and I am perplexed by the nature of this unexpected journey.&quot;

&quot;Right, the Shadowlands and all that. Sounds like a plot straight out of a video game or a movie,&quot; Lily remarked, taking a sip of her coffee.

Anduin observed the surroundings with a mixture of curiosity and confusion. &quot;Your realm is filled with wonders I could not have fathomed. The technology, the architecture—it is beyond my comprehension.&quot;

Lily chuckled, leaning back in her seat. &quot;Well, Anduin, you've got a lot to catch up on. But first, let's figure out how to get you back to wherever you came from. We can't have a prince getting lost in our world.&quot;

Anduin's gaze softened, gratitude evident in his expression. &quot;I appreciate your willingness to assist me, Lily. I am in your debt.&quot;

Lily waved off his formality with a laugh. &quot;No debts here, Anduin. We'll figure this out together. Now, tell me more about Stormwind and the Shadowlands. I'm all ears.&quot;

As Anduin began recounting tales of his world, Lily listened with a mix of fascination and amusement. The unexpected encounter with the displaced prince had turned her ordinary day into something extraordinary, and she couldn't help but wonder how this fantastical journey would unfold.</Text>

            <Title>Shadowy Interrogation</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Carolyn mind-controlling Hendel</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meanwhile, in Jaina’s office at the top of Theramore’s central tower, Carolyn gritted her teeth, steadying the tendrils of magic rising within her. She was vaguely aware of Kamery watching her with concern, but her focus was on the recalcitrant Private Hendel.
The man had resisted all of their attempts so far. Jaina had promised leniency, appealed to the man’s honor, and finally, she and Kamery had threatened violence. He had resolutely remained silent, telling them only that nothing they did would be worse than what he would face if he revealed anything. He hadn’t known about Carolyn though.
He would reveal everything now, whether he wanted to or not. He watched her as she approached, and she realized that at this moment, she felt more trepidation than he did—her mainly white robes and golden hair were a better reflection of her usual affinity for holy magic.
But holy magic wasn’t the only side of the Light that priests were trained in. The clerics of Northshire had been insistent in that and, knowing their experiences in the Wars, their novices listened closely. Darkness had value too, and those who drew on the Light could also draw on Shadow.
Focusing those Shadows now, Carolyn reached out into Hendel’s mind. Too late, the marine realized what was happening. He began to recoil, then stiffened, his mind under her control.
“Tell us everything,” Jaina commanded.
“Slim got me on the roster for the King’s ship.” Hendel spoke woodenly, his eyes staring blankly ahead. Carolyn suppressed a wince. “They gave me a device, said it would cause a distraction. When we got near Theramore, I set it off. It blew up, and they came up in rowboats. There was fog all around then, couldn’t see nothing. They got me on one of the boats, and took me to shore. I went back to duty.”
“What happened to the King?” Jaina asked coldly. She obviously did not share Carolyn’s distaste for their methods.
“I didn’t see,” Hendel responded. Carolyn could feel him fighting the spell, but he was speaking truthfully. She faintly nodded her confirmation at Jaina’s questioning glance, hoping the Lady would end it soon.
Jaina seemed to see the tension in Carolyn’s face then, and her voice softened as she addressed the priestess. “Release him.”
With relief, Carolyn pulled the Shadows from Hendel’s mind, pushing them back from her own mind as well. She felt a rush of gratitude as Kamery’s hand took hers reassuringly, and a tinge of surprise as Bryna’s hand also landed on her shoulder to give a small squeeze. Part of her wanted to apologize to the man for the invasion, but the knowledge of what he had willingly done won out and she turned away wordlessly.</Text>

            <Title>Bitter News - Raynn</Title>
            <Text>The hillside overlooking the construction of Orgrimmar stretched before Raynn, a canvas of ambition and determination. The rhythmic clang of hammers on metal echoed through the air, a symphony of creation that seemed to herald the birth of a new era for the orcs. Raynn couldn't help but feel a tinge of pride for the people who had become her unexpected kin.
Thrall stood beside her, his gaze fixed on the evolving city. The Warchief's presence exuded a mix of authority and responsibility, an unspoken weight carried on broad shoulders. As he turned to her, his eyes held both familiarity and a touch of the unfamiliar. It had been almost a year since they last crossed paths, and much had transpired in that time.
&quot;Raynn,&quot; Thrall's deep voice broke the silence, a rumble that resonated with a mix of acknowledgment and inquiry. His green eyes, a reflection of both leadership and an innate connection to the elements, searched hers.
&quot;Thrall,&quot; Raynn replied, a nod accompanying the greeting. She hesitated, a momentary flicker of uncertainty clouding her expression. The scars from Tichondrius's attack lay beneath her armor, unseen but a constant reminder of her journey. The cloak of the human blacksmith she now apprenticed with draped over her shoulders, a symbolic bridge between two worlds.
Her eyes met Thrall's again, and she decided to share the sentiment lingering in her thoughts. &quot;It's been a while,&quot; she acknowledged, her voice carrying a mix of curiosity and guarded warmth. &quot;I've heard of Orgrimmar and everything you've been doing here. It's impressive.&quot;
Thrall nodded, a silent acknowledgment of shared efforts. &quot;We're building a home, Raynn. A place for the orcs to thrive and find a new beginning.&quot;
Raynn's gaze returned to the sprawling cityscape below, a testament to resilience and perseverance. &quot;I've been living with the humans in Theramore,&quot; she confessed, the words unveiling a piece of her journey. &quot;Helping them build, trying to find my place.&quot;
A shadow of uncertainty passed through Thrall's eyes, a reminder of the complexities in the wake of their alliance with Jaina. &quot;How have you been, Raynn? Jaina has spoken highly of your courage.&quot;
Raynn's lips curved into a small smile, a blend of gratitude and humility. &quot;I've been recovering. The humans have been kind.&quot; She paused, realizing the gaps in her knowledge about the orcs' recent endeavors. &quot;I haven't heard much from the orcs since I was injured. What happened to Grom?&quot;
The name lingered in the air, a bridge between past and present, and Raynn awaited Thrall's response, her eyes holding an unspoken question.
Thrall's gaze shifted, a brief moment of solemnity clouding his features. &quot;Grom Hellscream,&quot; he began, the name carrying the weight of shared history, &quot;played a pivotal role in our fight against the Legion. His sacrifice allowed us to break free from the demonic curse that bound us.&quot; Thrall's eyes, tinged with both sorrow and respect, met Raynn's.
&quot;He faced Mannoroth, the demon who cursed our people, and with a single stroke, ended both their lives. Grom's sacrifice freed us, Raynn, but it came at a great cost.&quot;
Raynn's breath caught at Thrall's revelation, her eyes widening with a mix of shock and grief. The words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of the news she hadn't expected. Grom, her steadfast protector and mentor, had met his end in a blaze of heroism.
The hillside seemed to shift beneath her feet, and the distant echoes of Orgrimmar's construction became a distant hum. The absence of Grom's presence, the mentor who had guided her and the guardian who had pledged to protect her, left an unexpected void.
&quot;I didn't know,&quot; she finally whispered, her voice carrying a blend of sorrow and gratitude. Her fingers traced the outline of the scars concealed beneath her clothing, a silent acknowledgment of the sacrifices made in their journey to Kalimdor.
Thrall, the bearer of Grom's tale, met her gaze with understanding. The wind whispered through the hills, a lament for the fallen, and in the quiet solitude, Raynn began to reconcile with the reality of Grom Hellscream's sacrifice.</Text>

Raynn's previous relationship with Varian would undoubtedly have an impact on any potential romantic relationship with Anduin. Here are some dynamics and considerations that could shape their evolving connection:
**1. Guilt and Loyalty:**
   - Raynn may initially grapple with feelings of guilt, as if pursuing a romantic relationship with Anduin is a betrayal of Varian's memory. Loyalty to Varian may create inner conflict for her.
**2. Varian's Influence:**

   - If their relationship started with Raynn serving as Anduin's mentor, the shift from mentorship to romance might be a delicate process. Clear communication and navigating this transition could be challenging.
**5. Emotional Baggage:**
   - Raynn might bring emotional baggage from her relationship with Varian into her connection with Anduin. This could manifest as trust issues or a fear of repeating past mistakes.
**6. Varian's Approval:**

**9. Unresolved Feelings:**
   - Raynn might still carry unresolved feelings for Varian, and Anduin may have lingering feelings of inadequacy compared to his father. Both characters need to confront and address these emotions for a healthy relationship to develop.

   - Over time, as Raynn and Anduin build their own unique connection, they may find a way to honor Varian's memory while forging a new beginning together. It could be a story of growth, acceptance, and the resilience of the human (and orcish) spirit.
Navigating these complexities with sensitivity and nuance could contribute to a compelling and emotionally resonant narrative.

In exploring the potential for a romantic relationship, several key elements can be considered:
Shared Experiences: Raynn and Anduin have shared experiences in facing challenges and adversities together, fostering a sense of camaraderie. Shared experiences are often a foundation for deeper connections, including romantic ones.
Long-Term Friendship: The gradual development of their relationship over nine years implies a long-term friendship. Long-term friendships can evolve into romantic relationships as characters grow and change.
Mutual Respect: Anduin's respect for Raynn's choices, even when they differ from his own, indicates a level of understanding and respect. This mutual respect is a crucial component for the foundation of a romantic relationship.
Growth and Maturity: As Anduin matures, and Raynn witnesses his development, the potential for romantic feelings to develop becomes more plausible. People often find themselves drawn to others who have undergone personal growth.
However, it's important to note that the trajectory of a romantic relationship depends heavily on the narrative direction chosen by the storyteller. The gradual nature of their interactions suggests a slow-burning relationship, allowing feelings to develop organically over time.
To explore the romantic aspect, consider incorporating moments of vulnerability, shared confidences, and subtle hints of affection as the characters navigate the challenges presented in the World of Warcraft universe. Keep in mind that the pacing and nuances of their relationship should align with the overall tone and themes of the story.

Certainly! Creating a believable and logical romantic relationship between Raynn and Anduin involves thoughtful development of their connection. Here are some narrative suggestions:
1. **Emotional Bonds:** As Raynn and Anduin continue to face challenges together, introduce moments that deepen their emotional connection. This could be during times of celebration, shared victories, or moments of vulnerability.
2. **Personal Growth:** Both characters have individual journeys and growth arcs. Use these personal transformations to highlight their compatibility and understanding of each other's struggles. This can create a foundation for a deeper emotional connection.
3. **Subtle Gestures:** Incorporate subtle gestures that hint at underlying feelings. These gestures could include lingering looks, moments of shared silence, or acts of kindness that go beyond the realm of friendship.
4. **Shared Confidences:** Encourage moments where Raynn and Anduin share personal thoughts, fears, or aspirations. This vulnerability builds trust and fosters a deeper understanding of each other.
5. **Development of Anduin's Character:** As Anduin matures and takes on more responsibilities as a leader, explore how Raynn becomes a source of support and understanding for him. This could be both emotionally and strategically, showcasing her importance in his life.
6. **Unique Moments:** Create unique, intimate moments that are specific to their relationship. These could be quiet conversations, shared laughter, or instances where they rely on each other in pivotal situations.
7. **Acknowledging Feelings:** When the time is right in the narrative, allow one or both characters to acknowledge their growing feelings. This acknowledgment doesn't have to be dramatic; it can be a quiet realization or a moment of clarity.
8. **Obstacles and Resolutions:** Introduce challenges or obstacles that test their relationship. This could be external pressures or internal conflicts. Use these challenges to further strengthen their bond as they work together to overcome them.
Remember to maintain a balance between the romantic subplot and the overarching narrative. The key is to weave the romantic elements seamlessly into the story's fabric, ensuring that they enhance the characters' depth and contribute meaningfully to the overall narrative.</Text>

            <Title>Defeat of VanCleef</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Fighting VanCleef
- VanCleef targets Kamery
- Carolyn struggles to heal, then remembers mana potion</Synopsis>
            <Text>“VanCleef,” Raynn spoke firmly, although her ponytail swayed from side to side as she searched for the Defias leader. “This has to stop now. Surrender and return to face justice in Stormwind.”
Looking over the warrior’s shoulder, Carolyn’s eyes also scanned the deck between them and the cabin. If he was as skilled as Kamery and Elthas, he could be on them before they realized. Her instant-cast healing spell was working slowly, but surely, the warmth filling her shoulder, and she could feel her body mending. A moment later, the arrow fell to the deck with a small clink, the sound almost lost in the clash of weapons that erupted from the darkness at the side of the ship’s cabin.
At the sound, Raynn charged forwards. Blinking, Carolyn tried to make out what was happening. It was Kamery, she realized. The rogue must have spotted VanCleef as he attempted to make his escape. The priestess’s adrenaline surged as she flung a quick shield spell around her sister.
Kamery retreated, moving into the open space of the deck as Raynn reached the combatants. The warrior slammed her shield into VanCleef’s side, but he ignored her. A moment later, Elthas leaped into the fray from the other side of the cabin.
Carolyn cast her slow-acting instant heal on Kamery, trying to judge when she would need to start her slower spell-casting. Most of her other holy spells were more powerful, but they took time to cast, and were draining. Timing was the key, but most of her experience was with warriors, in their plate armor, not a rogue in leather. And not her sister. Carolyn’s heart tightened, and she began gathering the Light within her.
VanCleef was wielding twin sabers, and his strikes were hard, and fast. Kamery buckled under the assault, and Carolyn poured her healing Light into her sister.
As Kamery straightened, backpedaling again, Raynn finally managed to wedge her body between the two rogues. VanCleef finally acknowledged her, sneering, “Stormwind has no justice.” His hand twisted, not striking with his saber, but flinging sparkling, blinding dust in the warrior’s face. Raynn stumbled back, blinking furiously and rubbing at her eyes with the back of her right hand.
With a wild laugh, VanCleef turned on Elthas. “Fools! None may challenge the might of the Brotherhood and live to tell the tale!&quot; His sabers slashed down brutally at the black panther, striking twice before the druid shifted into his ursine form. Bloody seeped into the sandy brown hair above the runes on the bear’s shoulder. Carolyn pulled on the Light again, starting another powerful but draining spell.
VanCleef seemed impervious to their faltering attacks; he struck so hard and fast that neither Kamery nor Elthas had been able to land many blows. Although Bryna’s frost-bolts struck him with regularity, he seemed resistant to their chilling effect. Carolyn felt her shoulders slumping in exhaustion as she channeled healing Light into Elthas.
The druid roared in rage, swiping at the Defias leader, but he was flagging under the relentless assault. Carolyn drew in a deep breath, giving herself a moment to recover her strength before starting another spell.
Even as Raynn cleared her eyes, VanCleef turned again, his blades once more targeting Kamery. “You dare to defy us? You are a mere lapdog, barking at the heels of true power!” As she once more gathered the dregs of her power, Carolyn felt her thoughts drifting. Kamery had been investigating the Defias for some time now; did VanCleef know that? Was that the source of his focus? Did he have agents in Sentinel Hill or beyond?
The thought of Sentinel Hill triggered another memory in Carolyn’s mind. She had completely forgotten about the potions that Kamery had made the night before! As she spent the last of her energy bathing Kamery in another healing spell, she fumbled in her belt pouch for the small vial.
Pulling the vial free, she quaffed the blue liquid quickly, barely noticing the fresh, minty taste. The effect was instantaneous, filling her veins with refreshing energy. Renewed, she studied the combat more closely. She was becoming more accustomed to the speed and damage of VanCleef’s attacks now, and could time her spells better.
Raynn was also learning his patterns, it seemed, as the warrior managed to insert her shield between VanCleef and Kamery at a critical moment. Kamery used the reprieve to step backwards, darting behind Raynn momentarily, and emerging on the warrior’s other side to strike VanCleef’s side. It seemed like a glancing blow, but the Defias leader’s face twisted in pain.
&quot;Fools!” he snarled. “Our cause is righteous!” He was breathing heavily though, and his defiant words lacked the strength of earlier. Kamery had circled around behind him again, and he seemed too weary to turn, choosing instead to direct his sabers at Raynn.
Blocking his weakening attacks with her shield, Raynn tried once more to demand a surrender. “You don’t stand a chance,” the warrior pointed out. But it had no effect—VanCleef was too determined, had lost too much hope, was desperate.
As Kamery’s poisons coursed through his veins, he fell to one knee. Weakened, the light fading from his eyes, he was still defiant, promising, &quot;You may cut off the head, but the Brotherhood shall prevail.” He tumbled to the deck of the ship, still.
The only sound for several minutes was their heavy breathing, as they absorbed his final words.</Text>

            <Notes>Somebody has to use a damn potion - Kam didn’t make them for nothing

Kam is more familiar with the Defias - sympathy but know they’ve gone too far and need to be stopped.
Raynn - has only read Nobles’ history, no sympathy.
Caro may still have some sympathy? Sad about the Queen mostly.
Bry also didn’t know how bad it had gotten after the Stonemasons left Stormwind.
El has no idea any of Stormwind’s history.

Shaw: Having personally known Edwin VanCleef my entire life, I can tell you that facing him as a foe is quite a daunting task. You see, he was my childhood friend, and I personally trained him in the ways of the shadows thinking that one day he might consider a career alongside me. If VanCleef is heading up the Defias Brotherhood, may the Light have mercy on our souls. 

Alexston: Edwin... I see the years haven't changed you a bit, an idealist as ever, and a romantic. He doesn't care who he hurts. Revenge has consumed him. But then, I'm not sure I can blame him.

            <Title>32-10-L110-Fighting on Argus</Title>
            <Text>Illidan Stormrage stood resolute at the forefront of the forces pushing through the Legion-infested realms of Argus. Raynn, having witnessed his resurrection and understanding the gravity of their mission, fought by his side. The clash of blades and the roars of demons surrounded them as they pressed forward. In a moment of respite amid the chaos, Illidan turned to Raynn.

**Illidan:** Raynn, our fates are entwined in this battle. The Legion must fall, and we shall ensure it.

**Raynn:** (nodding) I've seen what you're capable of, Illidan. I trust in your vision for the future. We'll cut a path through these demons together.

**Illidan:** (smirking) Trust is a rare commodity in this war. But actions speak louder than words. Watch closely, and you'll see the might of the Illidari.

As demons lunged at them, the duo seamlessly coordinated their attacks. Illidan's warglaives danced with deadly precision, while Raynn's blades cleaved through the demonic horde. The air crackled with fel energy as Illidan unleashed his demonic powers.

**Raynn:** (grinning) Not bad, Illidan. Maybe I've underestimated the Illidari.

**Illidan:** (smirking) We are the hunters of demons, Raynn. The Legion will learn to fear our every step.

Their journey through Argus was a relentless struggle, but the alliance between Raynn and Illidan proved formidable. With every demon felled, they inched closer to Antorus, the Burning Throne, where the final battle against the Legion awaited.</Text>

            <Title>Priestess Down</Title>
            <Synopsis>- enter the Stockades
- rioting, Warden Thelwater suspicious
- Basil Thedd refuses to talk
- Thedd uses flash powder
- Carolyn dies; Elthas does battle res
- Thedd loses his head</Synopsis>
            <Text>Elthas and Kamery sat unnoticed in a corner of the guard post at the entrance to the Stormwind Stockades. Elthas’s paw idly waved back and forth in front of him, keeping time to a melody that hummed in his head. Across the corner, Kamery meticulously treated her daggers with foul-smelling liquids from small vials. The unpleasant scents blended into the backdrop of the city, far less noticeable than they had been in the clean air of Westfall.
He wondered if Carolyn would be successful in recruiting Raynn. If she wasn’t, he supposed he could protect the Humans in his ursine form, but he much preferred the sleek panther to the bear, which felt large and lumbering, despite its surprising agility. At least it wasn’t tall, he mused, with a twitch of his tail.
Her preparations complete, Kamery returned the vials to her belt pouch. She crouched, idly twirling her daggers in her hands, as her eyes swept the room, traveling from the entrance to the ramp that led down into the prison and back. Elthas felt his head tilt to one side as he pondered the idea of a prison that ran underneath the city; underneath the canals, he realized. He wondered if it was very wet.
In the dark shadows of the corner, the two were ignored by the guards and the Warden. Thelwater hadn’t been overly receptive to their earlier queries, scowling at them over crossed arms. He had even expressed his belief that they were allies of the Defias and would join the riot.
Elthas thought the idea was ridiculous, but the Human had glared at them, telling them that he would only allow them into the prison if they returned with the head of Basil Thedd, VanCleef’s one-time top lieutenant. The druid doubted that a severed head would be very talkative; they needed answers about the Defias’s remaining connections within Stormwind. Perhaps Thedd would be cooperative though, and tell them before they relieved him of his head.
A shadow passed across the bright midday sunlight that filtered in through the open entrance, and Kamery straightened. Elthas looked over, and was happily surprised to see that Carolyn had returned with not only Raynn, but Bryna also. He bounded over to the three, Kamery following close behind him.
“If it turns out you’re on his side,” Warden Thelwater warned, “we’ll kill you with the rest of the maggots.” Elthas’s muzzle wrinkled. Maggots were useful creatures, but he and his friends were not insects.
Raynn gave the Warden a hard look, and the man swallowed noticeably.
“Go on then,” he muttered. Louder, he barked to the guards defending the ramp, “Let them through.”
Raynn smiled grimly, a brief nod setting her ponytail swaying. Elthas was briefly hypnotized by the motion, but caught himself in time to pad after the others. As they descended, the shouting that had faded into the background upstairs grew louder, mixing with the clash of weaponry and the rattle of chains.
The low corridors of the prison were dimly lit, with torches flickering along the walls. Elthas reminded himself not to shift out of his animal forms. The ceiling was far too low.
Kamery seemed to notice his upward glances, as she walked softly beside him. She explained, “Low, and narrow, to limit movement.” She glanced down at him wistfully, and he felt an extra bounce in his step as he realized that his feline form would be the one least hindered in a fight.
Raynn paused as they reached the no-man’s land between the angry prisoners and the polearm-wielding guards who were keeping them at bay. There were narrow corridors leading in three directions. Left and right, they sloped downwards, while the one directly ahead was shorter, leading into an open room ringed with now-unlocked cells. The freed prisoners within seemed unconcerned with their group however. They were engaged in a heated discussion over what appeared to be a dice game.
“Which way?” Raynn asked.
Carolyn would have to provide the answer, as Elthas and Kamery had been unable to get very far in the chaos, even with their stealth abilities.
“Left,” the priestess directed. Her eyes unfocused slightly, and Elthas moved closer to her, protectively. The spell left her vulnerable, while her senses were focused elsewhere.
Raynn picked up on his motion, also moving in front of Carolyn, her shield at the ready.
A moment later, the priestess returned to herself, nodding. “Yes,” she confirmed. “They’re down at the end of the passage.”
The group made their way through the prison. Although the guards had seemed quite tense at the entrance, once inside, they found that many of the prisoners had no real interest in escape, or combat with such a determined, well-armed group. They had several short scuffles with chain-wielding bandits, which ended with the bandits unconscious or bleeding. After that, others stepped aside, waiting in their cells until the group had passed.
Raynn led the way confidently, Carolyn and Elthas close behind her. Kamery and Bryna followed, and when he looked back, Elthas noticed the rogue’s eyes darting about constantly, looking for threats. Bryna’s red hat looked particularly out of place in this dank setting.
Reaching the large chamber at the end of the corridor, they found their quarry. Thedd, a high-ranking member of the Defias Brotherhood, was flanked by a pair of his fellow insurgents. Curved scimitars gleamed in each of his hands, as he stood defiantly, prepared for combat. Elthas briefly wondered how he had gotten the weapons in here. His guards were armed with rough wooden truncheons made from broken furniture. All three wore the red bandannas of the Defias.
He wondered if Raynn would be able to hold the attention of all three, but decided that she would have no trouble. Although usually fairly taciturn and succinct, during combat she became quite loquacious, a master of taunts and insults. And if words failed, she could always draw an enemy’s ire with a solid blow from her shield or sword.
No, the bigger concern was whether Carolyn would be able to keep up with the damage those scimitars would deal. Elthas glanced at the low ceiling, wondering if he would need to shift and help heal. He knew that more experienced druids could heal directly from the animal forms, but he didn’t have the control required for that yet. Just speaking in form took effort. Carolyn looked calm and resolute though, so he returned his attention to the upcoming conflict.
Raynn stood in the center of the room, facing the Defias lieutenant determinedly.
“More of the warden’s errand runners?” Thedd scoffed. “Tell him the prison is ours. I don’t answer to him anymore.”
“What do you know of VanCleef’s plans?” Kamery demanded, ignoring Thedd’s words, as her eyes narrowed over her black bandanna. Although they had thought the threat ended by the destruction of the dreadnought in Westfall, the letter found by Kamery had hinted at further schemes. Elthas recognized Carolyn’s stubborn determination in the rogue’s pursuit of the matter.
Thedd sneered, and Elthas decided that he probably wouldn’t answer. At least, not without a fight. Fading into the shadows, he slunk quietly around the perimeter of the room. The remains of a broken chair to one side spoke of the origins of the henchmens’ weapons. Skirting a fetid puddle that he definitely did not want to investigate further, the druid took up a position on the flank of one of the insurgents.
His instincts proved correct, and Thedd’s sneer became a roar of rage, and with a flurry of slashes, he attacked. Raynn stepped forwards to absorb the brunt of the attack, her shield faltering under the sheer ferocity. A shimmering shield of holy light bolstered her defenses though, and she regrouped quickly.
Elthas leaped, pouncing on his target, his claws raking as he allowed the panther’s fighting instinct to flow through him. Beside him, Kamery joined the fray.
A surprised squeal made his ears twitch. Glancing over, he saw that where the second insurgent had once been, a confused pig now wandered. His golden eyes sought out Bryna through the flurry of blows that Raynn and Thedd were exchanging. The mage was grinning uncharacteristically. He wondered if that was a new spell. Frost coalesced around the mage’s hands as she joined the attack.
Under their combined assault, Thedd’s henchman didn’t last long. Bleeding and dazed, he stumbled to one side of the room and collapsed. Seeing that he was alone now, Thedd snarled in defiance, refusing to back down, much as VanCleef had.
The flash of his scimitars slowed momentarily, and Elthas wondered if the man was flagging, when suddenly a cloud of smoke engulfed them with a loud bang. Shaking his head to clear it, Elthas struggled to make sense of what had just happened. Next to him, Kamery coughed, and he could hear Raynn’s shout of anger.
The smoke began to clear, and the three looked around. Thedd had slipped away from their reach, and Elthas realized with a start that the Defias was almost on the two spell-casters. Bryna moved away, her hands flicking in a different spell, but it seemed to have no effect on Thedd. The mage’s face was tight with desperation.
Carolyn was mid-spell, and she watched Thedd approach with calm determination as she finished the incantation. Another whispered word, and a shimmering shield surrounded her as his scimitars descended. The golden shield shattered at the first blow, and the second sliced deep into the priestess’s shoulder. She grimaced, starting another spell. Elthas knew from experience that her most powerful spells took time to cast, and she couldn’t focus on anything more than light healing while running away. Shifting quickly, keeping his head low, he drew on the nature magic that accompanied him everywhere, even in this underground construction.
Raynn shouted, ramming into Thedd with her shield, but the Defias had seen their weakness, and wouldn’t be distracted. His scimitars swept down again. Raynn managed to block one, knocking it aside with her shield, but the other landed, tearing a gash across Carolyn’s thigh. Elthas knew that his spells were helping, but his nature magic worked slowly, gradually. Carolyn didn’t have that much time. He drew another spell to mind, rarely used, but drilled into every druid from the earliest days of training. He hoped that he wouldn’t have to use it, but he would be ready if he did.
Kamery was on Thedd now too, her daggers precise, her poisons potent, but their action was too slow. Thedd’s next two blows landed in quick succession, and Carolyn crumpled to the ground. Kamery’s attacks grew more frantic, but less precise.
Satisfied, with a sadistic grin, Thedd turned his scimitars on Raynn. His movements were slowing now, but the warrior had also lost some of her defiance at seeing the priestess fall. She stumbled under his assault. Bryna’s frost-bolts continued to pelt Thedd with vicious regularity. Elthas focused on Carolyn. She had fallen, yes, but her spirit had not yet left her body. He just had to pull the magic just…so.
Raynn stumbled, as Carolyn, unnoticed by the fighters, struggled to one knee. Elthas pushed his healing magic into Raynn now, knowing that she needed it more at this moment, even as she quaffed one of Kamery’s red potions. He was exhausted; he wasn’t fully trained as a healer. Carolyn caught his eye with a nod, and he shifted back to feline form, rejoining the attack.
Thedd faltered, then stumbled. One final stroke of Raynn’s sword claimed the Warden’s prize.
Exhausted and in shock, Raynn and Kamery stood dazed. Bryna was more clearheaded. From her position she had seen everything, and now she moved quickly to help Carolyn rise and steady herself. With a nod of thanks to the mage, Carolyn began casting a powerful healing spell. Elthas felt a surge of warmth spread though him, and knew that the spell had affected them all. Carolyn stood taller, no longer leaning on the mage, as Raynn and Kamery turned in shock.
Carolyn laughed, a slightly unsteady sound, as Kamery ran over to embrace her. Raynn looked from one member of the group to another in confusion. Bryna muttered an arcane spell, and the long-forgotten pig squealed as its transformation was renewed.
The rogue stood back, holding her sister at arms’ length, her eyes boring into Carolyn’s. Looking over at the druid, Carolyn answered all of their questions. “Elthas.”
The attention of all four was too much. Elthas studiously began licking his paw.
Carolyn laughed again. She knew him well.
“Let’s get out of here,” she suggested. “We can explain later.”
Nodding agreement, the others followed the priestess’s lead out of the cell. Kamery hesitated, crossing to where Elthas sat. The rogue crouched down in front of him, her nearness forcing him to meet her eyes. They shone with unshed tears, as she told him, “Thank you.”
Elthas bowed his head in acknowledgment. He pushed his voice through the feline throat, not wanting to shift—not wanting to break eye contact, as much as wanting to avoid the low ceiling. “She’s my best friend.”
Kamery wrapped her arms around him. He allowed her a moment, knowing this was uncharacteristic vulnerability for the rogue, then head-butted her as he stood and led them out of the prison.</Text>

            <Title>After Opening the Portal</Title>
            <Text>Bryna’s head whirled, trying to make sense of her last six hours. She frowned up at the sun, still high overhead, suggesting the passage of only a couple of hours. It had been six hours, she was sure; her internal clock was never wrong. She sighed, nudging her carpet forward over the dunes and away from the Caverns. With bronze dragons, she supposed she would need to reconsider her internal clock, along with her reading choices.
Sa’at had indeed needed her assistance in the time-way. He had been beset by darkly iridescent dragon-kin from the Infinite flight, whose purpose seemed to be to disrupt the history of Azeroth. Bryna had fought by his side, while at the same time, trying to watch Medivh work.
Running from one Infinite dragon time-rift to another in the crocolisk and jaguar-infested swamp, she had only caught a few glimpses of the Guardian’s powerful spell-casting. Purple and green energies had surrounded him, unlike anything she had seen before, accompanied by chants that had been far from arcane. Demonic, she thought, although she was no warlock to know for certain.
When he had completed his spell, the Dark Portal had shimmered with a horrible green energy as the Guardian had called out for Gul’dan to send his Horde through. The sight of the endless ranks of fel-empowered Orcs emerging from the Dark Portal had been chilling.
Bryna shivered in the hot sun, remembering the sight. That swamp, she knew, was now a dry and desolate land, blasted to ruin by the Demonic energies of the Portal. The area was now watched over by Stormwind soldiers stationed at Nethergarde Keep. The Portal itself stood inert, closed by the efforts of the Sons of Lothar, after they had chased the Horde back to their own world.
Filing away the memories of her last six hours—Bryna gave the sun another suspicious look—she shifted her weight on her carpet, picking up her speed across the hot sands back to Gadgetzan. Enough exploring for today, she decided, and possibly for the rest of the week. She didn’t think anything had ever turned her world upside-down quite like the Bronze Dragonflight had, and she needed time to properly adjust. Watching Raynn hammering away at enchanted metal sounded like a good idea.</Text>

            <Title>Clues in Duskwood</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Kamery and Carolyn find Defias documents in Duskwood, after days of running messages</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Duck!” Kamery threw her dagger with easy accuracy, noting with satisfaction that her sister was already moving, bending forward and to the side. The dagger struck true, and the Defias assailant fell almost instantly.
Carolyn glanced down, then looked back at Kamery, wrinkling her nose in distaste. “The eye?” she questioned. “Did it have to be the eye?” Straightening, the priestess deliberately ignored the fallen foe.
Kamery stared at her sister in bemusement. Carolyn, who had no compunctions whatsoever about cracking an enemy’s head open with her heavy staff, was squeamish about eyes. Who knew?
“Behind you!” Carolyn’s warning snapped Kamery back to the present, and she ducked and twisted to send a would-be ambusher flying over her shoulder instead. Carolyn’s staff landed a heavy blow on the back of the man’s head, and he lay still.
“Was that the last of them?” Carolyn asked, looking around the small farmstead.
Kamery nodded, double checking the number of the prone Defias thugs around them, and comparing it with her count before they had charged in. Well, until Carolyn had charged in. Kamery shook her head at her sister’s enthusiasm for melee.
The farm was small, and overgrown now. Dark, bare-branched trees loomed beyond the ramshackle fence that surrounded the small vegetable patch. Wisps of fog drifted between the branches, ever-present in this dank forest. Kamery shivered, thinking of the stories that had come out of this place. Of course, stories didn’t matter, when the more tangible threat of the Defias was here.
The Defias had driven out the farm’s original inhabitants, or worse, Kamery feared, to use the place as a hideout. It was one of the furthest homesteads from Darkshire, nestled in the shadows of the mountains that separated the forest from the southern lands that Kamery had only heard about in stories. This was the very edge of Stormwind’s territory.
As Carolyn led the way towards the run-down single-story farmhouse—probably little more than a single room—Kamery reflected on how they had come to be here. DeLavey’s man Jorgen had sent them with a message to Elling Trias, of all people. The cheese master certainly had his hands in all sorts of things.
Trias had grumbled, as usual, but had directed them here to Duskwood, where they had met with his contact in the Night Watch. Watcher Backus had told them about Defias activity at this farmstead. I thought my days of running messages were done in Westfall. Kamery shook her head as the sisters entered the small farmhouse.
A single lamp sputtered on a table, casting dim light around the single room. A bed in the far corner was broken, but on the floor near it were four dirty pallets, to match the four bandits they had dispatched outside.
Carolyn looked at the pallets in distaste. “I don’t want to have to search those,” she muttered, looking at Kamery. “Is this the sort of thing you usually do?”
Kamery laughed, nodding, as her eyes continued to scan the room. Dingy wooden walls, unadorned. Open beams on the ceiling, with the thatch above visible between them. The table was bare, save for the lamp. Debris littered the floor, but nothing looked particularly unusual. One of the pallets though, had an intriguing lump in it.
Walking over to the pallet, Kamery kicked the rough wool blanket aside with her foot, revealing an iron lock-box.
“You’re good at this,” Carolyn acknowledged, and Kamery warmed at the pride in her sister’s voice.
Picking up the lock-box, she brought it over to the table, setting it down next to the lamp.
“It’s locked.” Carolyn sounded disappointed.
Kamery chuckled again, as she pulled out her lock-picks. “This is what I do, remember?” she chided her sister. She deftly twisted the picks in the lock, and it gave a satisfying click. The box opened to reveal a packet of papers inside. She scanned them briefly in the dim light.
“I’m not sure what all this means,” the rogue admitted to her sister, handing over the papers for Carolyn to read also.
The priestess’s brow furrowed as she mumbled while reading, “Fist…Plan 2…Menethil…set sail…attack…custody… Are they planning to kidnap someone on the ship to Darnassus?”
Kamery’s eyebrow rose. She had forgotten the regular ships that sailed from Menethil Harbor to the Kaldorei home. Of course Carolyn would remember. She looked at her sister with pride. “It’s possible,” she agreed. “Let’s get these back to Backus, see if he can make any more sense of it.”
Carolyn nodded, glancing around the farmhouse with a mix of distaste and sympathy. “I wonder what happened to the people who lived here.”
Kamery shook her head. “Don’t,” she advised, turning to leave.
The sisters made their way back through the dark forest, returning to the packed dirt and worn cobblestones of the road without incident, despite the near-continuous howling of wolves in the hills around them. Lanterns lit the way back to Darkshire, and reaching the town, they handed the papers they had found over to Watcher Backus.
Scanning the documents, Backus looked at them with concern. “This looks way too complex to be a red herring,” he deemed. “Best take these to Trias—he’ll be able to make sense of it.”
Of course he would, Kamery mused, wondering again just how much the cheese master was involved in. Thoughts of Trias inevitably brought back memories of the small band she had assembled to take on the Defias before, and she wondered what Bryna, Raynn, and Elthas were doing now.</Text>

            <Title>Feralas</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Carolyn and Elthas explore Feralas</Synopsis>
            <Text>They had taken a wrong turn somewhere, Elthas realized, as the deep canyon led him and Carolyn out into a wide salt flat. Perhaps they should have consulted a map before they had left, but he had been too eager to get away from the judgmental looks. It was too late now. They had been getting increasing more lost over the past week, since leaving Feathermoon Island.
Feralas had been wonderfully wild. Ancient trees had soared overhead, their leaves filtering the sunlight without blocking it. Cheerful chirping had told the story of birds occupying the high branches, while distant roars and growls had spoken of the wildlife below. The forest floor had been covered with lush grass and ferns, and moss-covered rocks had abounded. Exotic flowers had filled their air with their fragrances. A well-maintained road had led eastwards.
They had roamed off the road a few times, exploring the lush forest. However, after encounters with angry Ogres and Quel’dorei ghosts, they had decided to stay on the well-cobbled path for the rest of the journey eastward. Until, of course, it led directly into a Tauren village—which did explain who was responsible for the upkeep of the road. The Tauren, members of the Horde, had been decidedly unfriendly, prompting a swift retreat.
Consequently, Elthas and Carolyn had skirted wide to the south of the village, through the wilds. Before they’d had a chance to turn north to find the road again, the forest had abruptly ended and they had emerged into the deep, pinnacle-filled canyon of Thousand Needles.
Although the canyon’s presence along their route, beyond the forest, had been expected, the change in terrain had been startling. The rust-colored sandstone had stretched before them, a stark contrast with the verdant forest. Camping at the edge of the forest for one last night, they had briefly discussed lingering there for a while. However, neither of them was comfortable so close to the Tauren village, so they had continued on.
The sun burning overhead had helped to guide them roughly eastward. The canyon floor had been filled with towering sandstone mesas, which had cast wide shadows and caused constant detours in their path. They had tried their best to keep a straight line, but somehow, they had never found the road again. The striations in the rocky outcroppings had been interesting, showing layer upon layer of history, but life on the canyon floor had been limited to a few dry bushes, lazy lizards, and large insects.
Now, standing at the edge of the deep canyon, they faced a vast white plain that stretched into the distance to the south and east. The late morning sun beat down on the parched surface, with no shade in sight. Although they had filled their waterskins from Feralas’s sparkling streams, they had consumed most of it while crossing the dry ravine.
“The road!” Carolyn’s voice cracked slightly, but she was smiling as she pointed to the north. A winding track emerged from the canyon on the far side of the last pillar. She lifted her waterskin, but after a glance at the salt flat, she took only a small sip.
Elthas shifted out form to respond. “We’ve missed the turn to the Barrens then.” He stretched his shoulders as he considered their options. His knowledge of the southern reaches of Kalimdor was hazy, but he did know that they would need to cross the vast central plains to reach Theramore. Deserts and salt flats lay too far south. Of course, Theramore had only been an idea. The Human city was only halfway down the eastern coast of the continent—there was an entire other half to explore!
Brows crinkling, Carolyn stared distractedly across the salt flat. From her vantage point on her moonsaber’s back, she could see further than he had been able to in cheetah form. He followed her gaze. In the distance, a dark hazy shape shimmered in the heat, and the beaten track seemed to lead directly to it.
Glancing at his friend, Elthas knew what the priestess was thinking. Carolyn was stubborn; she wouldn’t want to turn back and retrace their steps. He shifted to feline form, nimbly leaping up onto the sloping base of the stone pillar that they stood beneath. Small rocks clattered as his paws dislodged them, but he kept his balance. From the new vantage point, he could make out an jumbled assortment of buildings. Sunlight glinted off metal, as something sped past the buildings.
Leaping down, he returned to Kaldorei form once more. “It looks like a settlement of some sort. There was movement.” A memory surfaced. “I think the Steamwheedle Goblins have a town somewhere in southern Kalimdor.”
He tried to keep his voice matter-of-fact, but he could tell that she sensed his intrigue. Exploring new places with maps was fun; exploring without maps was exhilarating. The amused sparkle in her eyes told him that he had failed, but that she shared his opinion. With one more sparing sip of water, they started out, angling to meet the road.</Text>

            <Title>Descent into the Core</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Fighting into the Molten Core
- Extinguishing runes?
- Beating up Majordomo Executus</Synopsis>
            <Text>As the small army proceeded into the Molten Core, Bryna refreshed her shield of frost. The icy magic helped against the oppressive heat. Even more so than the outer tunnels that formed the city of the Dark Iron Dwarves, the Core was built over open pools and streams of magma. The air around them rippled with the heat, making breathing difficult.
They weren’t without recourse though, as she and others had woven enchantments through much of the armor and weapons they used. Kamery had also provided them with potions that would completely neutralize the effects of heat and fire, but the alchemist rogue had warned that the potent potions were short-lived, so they were only to be used in dire circumstances.
Raynn had recently completed her set of dark iron armor, and she strode tall and easily at the head of the advance. At the warrior’s side, Broll looked a little less comfortable, in his ursine form, but he proceeded without complaint. Nearer Bryna, she could see Elthas, equally uncomfortable, with his ears flat and his whiskers drooping.
Determination won out over discomfort though, along with hope.
Not long after receiving their Royal Commission, they had been sent to the Searing Gorge, to disrupt the Dark Iron mining operations there. One thing had led to another, culminating with the return to the depths of Blackrock Mountain, and the death of Emperor Dagran Thaurissan.
Part of the fallout of the Emperor’s death had been the dissemination of the knowledge of just how deep Ragnaros’s influence went with the Dark Iron Dwarves. That knowledge had attracted the attention of opposing water elementals. After proving themselves to the Waterlords, they had been granted an enchanted vial that would extinguish the runes that protected the inner sanctum of the Firelord.
That vial now lay in Bryna’s backpack, in a specially protected pocket.
The runes were protected by the captains of the Fire Lord’s armies, powerful Flamewalkers, but they were no match for the determination of Varian’s army. One by one, the captains fell, and the runes were extinguished.
At the seventh, final, rune, the earth of the caverns shuddered and trembled, and a new path opened before them, spiraling upwards to a high underground mesa. Atop the plateau waited Ragnaros’s majordomo and his honor guard.
The guards, Bryna noted with satisfaction, were vulnerable to polymorph. She enacted the spell, and gave a smirk of irony as one of the Flamewalkers shrunk down to a polar bear cub with a surprised squeak. Jaina and another mage followed her example in a more mundane way, transforming their targets into sheep.
As the harmless creatures wandered aimlessly on the battlefield, the mages turned their more destructive spells to the remainder of the guards, who had converged on Broll, as Raynn kept the attention of the majordomo himself—Executus, their watery allies had told them.
As the last of his guards fell, Executus showed his true nature. “Impossible! Stay your attack, mortals… I submit! I submit!”
“Where is your master?” Varian demanded. The King’s breathing was harsh from combat, but his voice was regal and commanding.
Executus slithered away, cowed, but still defiant. “I go now to summon the lord whose house this is. Should you seek an audience with him, your paltry lives will surely be forfeit! Nevertheless, seek out his lair, if you dare!”
Following his trail, they soon reached an even deeper level of the cavern, previously sealed, where the rock spiraled down to the very level of the magma. At a pool of magma in the center, Executus stood prepared to summon Ragnaros. The army spread out along the curving arms of stone that cut through the magma, with Varian and Shaw directing their positioning.</Text>

            <Title>Rend Blackhand</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Kill Rend Blackhand</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn slammed her shield forward, trying to disrupt the Orc’s single-minded pursuit of their healer. Although the warrior knew that Elthas could revive Carolyn, Raynn did not want to see the priestess fall again.
Once again, she forcefully placed her body between the furious Orc and her healer. She had to get his attention. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Bryna conjuring a snowstorm to deal with the remaining whelplings.
“Rend Blackhand,” she spat, and was rewarded by a snarl of acknowledgment. Raynn remembered standing on a low hill in Durotar, looking at the newly-build Orcish city.
“Orgrimmar,” Thrall told her it was called; named for the former Warchief of the Horde whose armor and weapon Thrall now wore. He told her of Orgrim Doomhammer, who had wrested control of the Horde from Blackhand and the Shadow Council, regaining their honor. Although Orgrim had fallen during the liberation of the Horde in the Arathi Highlands, not far from where Raynn’s own parents had died, his legacy lived on within Thrall, the new Warchief. Blackhand’s son had evaded capture, and had gathered the remnants of the old Horde at Blackrock Mountain. He had declared himself Warchief, refusing to follow Thrall to Kalimdor.
Smirking at the Orc before her, she switched to Rend’s own language. “False Warchief,” she taunted in Orcish. “Son of a tyrant.”
She was getting his attention now. She smiled grimly as she parried a furious swing of his polearm. Feeling Carolyn’s healing warmth spread through her body, she focused on keeping Rend’s attention. “Ur’gora.”
Rend became reckless in his fury at the insult, his blade swinging wildly. Behind him, Kamery dodged the flurry, then resumed her attacks. Elthas was less nimble, and hissed in pain as his left ear was lopped off. Holy light glowed over the wound moments later. No longer set on her heels, Carolyn had stepped to one side and was whispering healing spells once more.
Rend’s uncontrolled attack had left him out of position. Seeing her opportunity, Raynn thrust forward with her sword, driving it into his abdomen, exposed by his traditional war harness. With a grunt, he fell to his knees. His single red eye was fixed on her now, still glowing with hatred.
Pulling her sword free, Raynn stared into his scarred, hatred-twisted face. “Lok-tar ogar,” she whispered. His eye closed, and he fell.
Raynn stood a moment longer, then dropped to her knees. Her head fell back, eyes closing, as emotions roiled through her. Although he was far from the first Orc they had fought, something had been different, facing the erstwhile Chieftain’s heir.
She could feel her friends gathering around her in silent camaraderie. Opening her eyes, she saw Vaelastrasz was looking from one end of the room to the other, frowning at the closed gates in either direction.
Looking up at the spectators on the balcony above, she saw shock in their eyes, but also respect. One, who seemed to be their leader, inclined his head slightly. He gestured to another with one hand, his eyes not leaving Raynn.
A moment later, the gate that they had entered from rattled open. Raynn nodded in return to the Orc. They had won the right to face the black dragon champion.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Elthas returns to Darnassus to train further, learning his cheetah and sea lion forms. Carolyn travels with him to Darnassus, and acquires her Moonsaber mount</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meanwhile, in the forest surrounding Darnassus, the trees flashed past Elthas as he reveled in his newest form. The lean cheetah wasn’t as fierce in combat as the panther, but it was built for speed. It wasn’t as pretty either, he thought, with a critical glance at one mottled paw stretched out ahead of him. Covered with tawny yellow-brown fur and marked with dark spots, it couldn’t compare to the sleek black panther.
But the speed! In this form, he could easily keep up with the horses that most Humans rode, and even with Carolyn’s moonsaber.
They had recently returned for a visit to Darnassus. While he had been learning his new form, Carolyn had begged and wheedled Lelanai until the saber handler had relented and allowed Carolyn to approach the mounts. The priestess had learned much about the Kaldorei since her previous attempt—much of it from Elthas himself—and her bond with the large grey cat had been instantaneous and unmistakable.
Mollified, Lelanai had allowed her to purchase the animal, and her partner Jartsam had given Carolyn lessons on riding it. Elthas smiled, baring his fangs, as he remembered his two Kaldorei friends telling him about the Human’s stubborn persistence.
The moonsaber, he had learned early in their friendship, had been her primary motivation for traveling to Darnassus in the first place. She had long been enamored with the domesticated tigers ridden by the Kaldorei. Studying with Tyrande Whisperwind, the High Priestess of Elune, had been secondary. He chuffed a laugh at the thought.
Carolyn was waiting patiently for him now though, he remembered, turning back towards Darnassus. There had been disturbing news of increasing Naga activity at Feathermoon stronghold, far to the south in Feralas, and they had volunteered to offer aid. The hippogryphs were waiting.</Text>

            <Text>Raynn watched as Varian lingered, his silhouette a contrast against the moonlit backdrop. The tension in the air seemed to waver, and she couldn't help but feel a subtle shift in the atmosphere.
&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; she spoke, her voice steady but laced with a sincerity that transcended their roles. &quot;In war, we face countless trials, but it's in unity that we find strength. Our differences, though stark at times, can be our greatest asset.&quot;
Varian turned to face her once more, his gaze meeting hers with a depth she hadn't expected. The weight of his responsibilities seemed to carve lines on his face, revealing a vulnerability seldom seen. Raynn, though resolute in her convictions, recognized a shared burden in the eyes of Stormwind's king.
&quot;Strength and dedication,&quot; Varian mused, the words hanging in the air like an unspoken truth. &quot;Your commitment to your cause is admirable, Commander Tanner.&quot;
Raynn inclined her head in acknowledgment, a flicker of understanding passing between them. The battlefield had taught her to respect strength, even when it wore a crown she questioned. She couldn't deny the allure of Varian's power, a trait she admired even as their perspectives clashed.
As Varian turned to leave, the moment lingered. Raynn's amber eyes followed him, a mixture of curiosity and something more. The moonlight seemed to soften the edges of the world, casting a gentle glow on Lunarfall.
The wind whispered through the Garrison, carrying with it the echoes of their conversation. Raynn remained on the hill, the night unfolding around her, as she contemplated the complexities of alliances, convictions, and the unspoken connection that had woven its thread through the tapestry of their encounter.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Bryna distracts the group with talk of future plans, while waiting for Elthas</Synopsis>
            <Text>Bryna floated lazily on her back in the cool water. In the shelter of the islands, the water was calm, with only slight waves and the salty scent to remind her that she was in an ocean. Overhead, the sun was shining warmly, and she reflected that Theramore was well-located, if not for the swamp that surrounded it on land. She had tipped her hat forward slightly to shade her eyes as she relaxed, but now, she cracked open one eye to look over at Kamery.
The rogue was treading water nearby, next to Renn. The helmeted SI:7 diver seemed inexhaustible, and Bryna wondered how long he had been out here. Beyond them, Carolyn was more relaxed, near the rocky outcropping that they were using to shield themselves from the view of the Defias on the nearby island. All three were looking anxiously towards Alcaz Island, focusing on the open sea between, where Elthas was searching for the Defias cargo.
Elthas had only been gone twenty minutes, Bryna calculated; her internal sense of time had been well-honed keeping track of polymorph spells. Not long enough to be worried yet, she decided.
“What are you going to do after this?” she asked, hoping to provide a distraction. Perhaps she was hoping for some inspiration herself also, she had to admit.
The rogue turned in surprise to meet her one open eye. “What do you mean? We have to find…” She trailed off, perhaps unsure how much Renn knew about their quest.
Bryna nodded impatiently. “Yes, but after that.” At Kamery’s look of confusion, she expounded, “After that, he’ll be back”—she edited out ‘on the throne’ for Renn’s sake—“in Stormwind. Then, what will you do?”
Carolyn was watching with interest, so Bryna opened her other eye and included the priestess in the question with a raised eyebrow. Carolyn looked at Kamery, her expression hopeful, but stayed silent to hear her sister’s answer first.
Kamery didn’t miss the look and gave her sister a rueful look. “I suppose Shaw will have something else for me to do.” She spread her hands across the surface of the water in a helpless gesture. “I’m still pretty junior; I don’t have much say in where he sends me. It was nice working with you though.” That was directed at Carolyn, but then she included Bryna and Elthas with, “and meeting your friends.”
Carolyn smiled her gentle smile, and Bryna was glad to see that the priestess was her usual peaceful self again. “I feel the same. Perhaps we can spend some time in Stormwind…” She trailed off, her eyes returning to the open expanse of water.
Kamery understood; she seemed to understand the druid well, although they hadn’t known each other long. “I can ask for an assignment outside the city,” she offered. “Before all this, I was running messages from Westfall to Redridge.” She returned her attention to Bryna. “Not very exciting, I’m afraid.”
Bryna smirked slightly, acknowledging the rogue’s perceptiveness.
Carolyn had a pensive look. “If Shaw doesn’t have anything for you right away, there were a lot of people in Menethil who needed help. I saw it both times.” She frowned in self-chastisement. “I’d like to return there sometime. And maybe spend more than half a day in the town.” She laughed a little.
Bryna had heard the story of Carolyn’s excited rush to get to Darnassus. She hadn’t understood the priestess’s obsession with the Kaldorei city, but she well understood the desire to go somewhere new. Although, she knew that she would have taken the time to see the sights along the way—or just learned the teleportation spell, she admitted to herself, realizing that she had never seen Menethil or the Wetlands either.
“Sorry to interrupt,” Renn’s echoing voice broke in, “but I believe your friend is returning.”
A sleek, silver-grey shape glided swiftly up to them from the depths. Elthas broke the surface as he approached, his wiry whiskers twitching as he drew in a breath. Around his body, he had managed to loop the straps of a large satchel, weighted down with several lock-boxes.
In short order, the two SI:7 agents loosened the satchel, unlocked the boxes, and started riffling through them, as Elthas drifted over towards Carolyn.</Text>

            <Title>Sparring</Title>
            <Text>The sun dipped low over Raynn's Garrison, casting long shadows across the training grounds. The clang of steel echoed as Raynn sparred with her iconic weapon, Shadowmourne, its dark aura adding an ominous touch to the dance of blades. Varian Wrynn stood at the edge of the training area, watching with a keen eye.
Varian: Impressive as always, Raynn. That weapon of yours is a sight to behold.
Raynn, catching her breath, offered a nod of acknowledgment.
Raynn: Thank you, Your Majesty. Shadowmourne has served me well.
Varian: (smirking) Don't go easy on me now. I didn't come all this way for a leisurely stroll.
Raynn grinned, the dark runes on Shadowmourne reflecting the dimming sunlight. She prepared for another round, the air charged with anticipation.
Varian: I've been thinking, Raynn. About Anduin.
Raynn, focused but attentive, arched an eyebrow.
Raynn: What about him, Your Majesty?
Varian: (parrying a strike) He's a pacifist in a world that seems to revel in conflict. Sometimes, I can't help but worry.
Raynn: (lunging) Anduin's strength lies in his convictions, not in a sword. He believes in a better way, even when the world disagrees.
Varian: (blocking) A better way, yes. But I can't help but wonder if he'll face a world that refuses to see reason.
Raynn: (sidestepping) Anduin's strength isn't just in his beliefs; it's in his ability to inspire change. You've seen it, Your Majesty. He's not afraid to challenge the status quo.
Varian: (counter-attacking) True, but this world can be unforgiving. I worry about him facing the harsh realities that we, as warriors, understand all too well.
Raynn: (parrying) Anduin has allies. He has you, and he has the Alliance. We'll stand by him.
Their blades locked for a moment, both warriors catching their breath.
Varian: You're right, Raynn. He's not alone. And he has warriors like you to look up to.
Raynn: (smiling) And you, Your Majesty. We all play our part.
Varian acknowledged the sentiment with a nod, a silent understanding passing between them. The sun dipped lower, casting a warm glow over the Garrison, as Raynn and Varian resumed their sparring — a dance of blades that mirrored the complexities of the world they sought to protect.</Text>

            <Title>A Curious Bargain</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Kamery arrives in Gadgetzan
- She conveys Shaw's suggestion that they build their skills
- Bryna suggests Un'goro Crater as a good source of natural resources</Synopsis>
            <Text>The cutter had been exhilaratingly fast, and Kamery had made it to Tanaris in seven days exactly. She was still marveling over the speed of the whole thing as she rode along the rough road towards Gadgetzan. She could already see the low, brown clay walls of the city rising up from the undulating sand dunes that surrounded it. In some ways, the dry lifelessness of the terrain reminded her of the Badlands, but rather than the hard-packed red soil there, here the sand was light brown and drifted loosely in the gusts of wind.
The salty scent of the sea faded quickly behind her, replaced by a dusty dryness. Although the sun was still only midway up the sky in the east, the heat was oppressive, and her black leather outfit wasn’t helping. Her bandanna seemed to help keep the dust out of her nose and mouth though, so Kamery left it on. Approaching the city, the road split in two, leading to gates in the north and south.
The southern path looked slightly shorter, so she turned that way. The gateway was framed in wood, with the angled arch rising higher than the walls themselves. Kamery passed easily underneath it, even on horseback.
Once inside, she scanned the town briefly, before the rhythmic pounding of a blacksmith’s hammer caught her attention from her immediate left. Looking over, she felt a start of surprise. Raynn’s back was to her, but the auburn ponytail was unmistakable. The warrior, she noted with some envy, had removed some of her armor in the heat.
Kamery dismounted, sending her horse away, and walked around to where the blacksmith-warrior would see her.
“Kamery!” Raynn’s hammer stilled its movements as the warrior’s face broke into a friendly smile.
A tall Kaldorei beside her frowned, asking with some exasperation, “How many more friends do you have here?” He motioned for Raynn to leave her work though, and stepped away to let them talk.
Hope flared in Kamery. “Is Carolyn here?” She glanced around the small town again.
Raynn nodded, casting an apologetic look at her tutor as she set down her hammer next to a nearly-finished breastplate. “Carolyn, Elthas, and Bryna. They’re out exploring Troll ruins now.”
“Well, that makes my mission easier.” Kamery grinned. She gave in to the heat then, reaching up to loosen the collar of her leather tunic. She would have to buy a lighter shirt somewhere.
Raynn’s face hardened, her body stiffening, and her voice was cooler as she repeated, “Mission.”
Kamery shook her head, “No. Well, yes, but—” The rogue paused, straightening her thoughts. “Shaw sees the value in everything, even friendships.”
Raynn considered that silently, but at least she was considering it. Kamery decided to take that as a sign of hope, and continued.
“Our group, we came together so well, we can do a lot of good for the Kingdom.” The rogue’s grey eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled under her bandanna. “That doesn’t mean we can’t also enjoy our time with each other.”
The warrior nodded, relaxing somewhat, her face still thoughtful. “What does Shaw want us to do now?”
“Blackrock mountain, eventually,” Kamery admitted. “But we’re not ready for that yet, so for now, he just wants us to stay together, to learn to work together even better.”
“To get to know one another better?” Raynn asked carefully, her lingering suspicion coloring her voice.
Kamery shook her head, trying to explain. “He—we are curious by nature. We like to know everything about a situation, to analyze it from all sides.”
Raynn’s face darkened again. “My life is not a situation that needs analyzing.”
Kamery considered that. She and Shaw, all of SI:7 really, viewed the world as a chessboard, with the people in it just the pieces. But Raynn was right; people were more than just chess pieces.
“I’m sorry,” she apologized, but she had to be honest also, “I can’t promise to stop being curious. I can’t even promise to stop asking questions. But”—she forestalled Raynn’s protest—“I can promise to accept if you don’t want to answer.”
Mollified, Raynn accepted that with a nod. Kamery was still curious what it was in the warrior’s past that she didn’t want to talk about so badly, but she accepted now that she wouldn’t keep pushing. Satisfying her curiosity wasn’t worth the price of this friendship.
Honesty drove her once more, to warn, “I can’t make the same promise about Shaw.”
Raynn accepted that now though. Perhaps she also felt that their friendship was worth it.</Text>

            <Title>Regrouping</Title>
            <Text>Waiting back at the entrance to the lower city, Raynn paced back and forth along the walkway leading from the lower reaches to the sealed door to above. She could feel Bryna’s eyes watching her, from below the brim of her hat, as the mage sat casually on a stone bench near the lower entrance.
Carolyn had been watching Kamery and Elthas’s progress through the eyes of the Orcs and Trolls that they passed, so she knew that they were making good progress. Vaelan had resumed his Orc disguise and gone back into the city, although he had warned that he wouldn’t be able to do much if the rogue and druid stirred up trouble.
“I’ve lost them,” Carolyn muttered, her eyes refocusing on the group in front of her.
“What do you mean?” Raynn strode over to the priestess, standing near Bryna at the lower ramp. “Do we need to go in?”
But Carolyn shook her head. “They went into the Quartermaster’s office, but there’s nobody around for me to see with. I need line of sight.” The priestess rubbed her forehead, pinching the bridge of her nose between thumb and forefinger. She looked exhausted, Raynn realized. Dropping her hand, Carolyn’s eyes began to lose focus again as she said, “I can watch the exit.”
Raynn caught the priestess’s hand, stopping her. “Rest for a while. This is the last, right? They’ll come back here soon enough.”
Carolyn considered for a moment, then nodded. Bryna offered her some magically conjured refreshment, and she gratefully accepted, sitting down beside the red-hatted mage.
A few minutes later, Vaelan emerged, dropping his disguise as he approached them. “They’re returning. Let us prepare for our last step. The Seal must be forged in the breath of the Black Dragonflight. Luckily for us,” he reassured them, “a lesser dragonspawn will suffice. Wyrmthalak is the overlord and taskmaster of the forces below. We should be able to reach him with little trouble.”</Text>

            <Title>The New Horde</Title>
            <Synopsis>Thrall's escape from Durnholde and search for his heritage.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The chief warden of the internment camps, Aedelas Blackmoore, watched over the captive orcs from his prison-stronghold, Durnholde. One orc in particular had always held his interest: the orphaned infant he had found nearly eighteen years before. Blackmoore had raised the young male as a favored slave and named him Thrall. Blackmoore taught the orc about tactics, philosophy, and combat. Thrall was even trained as a gladiator. All the while, the corrupt warden sought to mold the orc into a weapon.
Despite his harsh upbringing, young Thrall grew into a strong, quick-witted orc, and he knew in his heart that a slave's life was not for him. As he grew to maturity, he learned about his people, the orcs, whom he had never met: after their defeat, most of them had been placed in internment camps. Rumor had it that Doomhammer, the orc leader, had escaped from Lordaeron and gone into hiding. Only one rogue clan still operated in secret, trying to evade the watchful eyes of the Alliance.
The resourceful yet inexperienced Thrall decided to escape from Blackmoore's fortress and set off to find others of his kind. During his journeys Thrall visited the internment camps and found his once-mighty race to be strangely cowed and lethargic. Having not found the proud warriors he hoped to discover, Thrall set out to find the last undefeated orc chieftain, Grom Hellscream.
Constantly hunted by the humans, Hellscream nevertheless held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. Aided only by his own devoted Warsong clan, Hellscream continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of his beleaguered people. Unfortunately, Hellscream could never find a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. The impressionable Thrall, inspired by Hellscream's idealism, developed a strong empathy for the Horde and its warrior traditions.
Seeking the truth of his own origins, Thrall traveled north to find the legendary Frostwolf clan. Thrall learned that Gul'dan had exiled the Frostwolves during the early days of the First War. He also discovered that he was the son and heir of the orc hero Durotan, the true chieftain of the Frostwolves who had been murdered in the wilds nearly twenty years before.
Under the tutelage of the venerable shaman Drek'Thar, Thrall studied his people's ancient shamanistic culture, which had been forgotten under Gul'dan's evil rule. Over time, Thrall became a powerful shaman and took his rightful place as chieftain of the exiled Frostwolves. Empowered by the elements themselves and driven to find his destiny, Thrall set off to free the captive clans and heal his race of demonic corruption.
During his travels, Thrall found the aged warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, who had been living as a hermit for many years. Doomhammer, who had been a close friend of Thrall's father, decided to follow the young, visionary orc and help him free the captive clans. Supported by many of the veteran chieftains, Thrall ultimately succeeded in revitalizing the Horde and giving his people a new spiritual identity.
To symbolize his people's rebirth, Thrall returned to Blackmoore's fortress of Durnholde and put a decisive end to his former master's plans by laying siege to the internment camps. This victory was not without its price: during the liberation of one camp, Doomhammer fell in battle.
Thrall took up Doomhammer's legendary warhammer and donned his black plate-armor to become the new warchief of the Horde. During the following months, Thrall's small but volatile Horde laid waste to the internment camps and stymied the Alliance's best efforts to counter his clever strategies. Encouraged by his best friend and mentor, Grom Hellscream, Thrall worked to ensure that his people would never be slaves again.</Text>

            <Title>Healing, Failed - Jaina</Title>
            <Text>Jaina approached the orc Warchief, her curiosity piqued by the visible struggle in Thrall's eyes. The soothing green glow of shamanistic healing emanated from his hands, casting an ethereal light over the still form on the ground. She couldn't help but wonder who the patient was, hidden beneath the armor and unconsciousness.
As she drew nearer, her eyes widened with surprise. A human. Amidst the orc ranks. The realization hit her like a sudden gust of wind, leaving her momentarily speechless. Her gaze lingered on the unconscious girl, absorbing the unexpected sight. Thrall, the orc Warchief, had forged an alliance with her people, but the presence of another human among them was unforeseen.
&quot;I hadn't known... another human among your ranks,&quot; she finally revealed, her tone carrying a mix of fascination and concern. The scene unfolded before her, painting an unexpected picture of unity and shared struggle.
As Thrall's frustration with his healing attempts became palpable, Jaina sensed his inner turmoil. His helplessness mirrored her own feelings when confronted with the uncertainty of the young warrior's fate. There was a shared understanding, a common thread of compassion that transcended the boundaries of their races.
Determined to offer a solution, Jaina pressed on, &quot;Thrall, there is another way. I can take her to Stonetalon Peak, to our human encampment. She'll find healing among her own people, far from the brewing conflicts with the Night Elves and the Legion.&quot;
In that moment, as she spoke those words, Jaina glimpsed Thrall's hesitation. His gaze lingered on the unconscious form, torn between duty and concern. She respected the internal struggle, recognizing the burden of leadership.
&quot;Do what you must, Jaina. Ensure she finds the healing she needs,&quot; Thrall reluctantly agreed, his voice carrying the weight of a leader faced with difficult choices.
With a swift incantation, Jaina harnessed the arcane energies, teleporting herself and the mysterious young warrior to the haven of the Stonetalon Mountains.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Shaw sends Kamery back to Anduin and enters the throne room
- Kamery finds Anduin playing with Elthas while Broll watches
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Hidden in the shadows of the doorway to the throne room, Kamery reeled from seeing Windsor disappear in flames right in front of her. Mourning would have to wait though, as the keep was now swarming with black dragonspawn rushing to answer Onyxia’s call. Shaw’s face was grim as he gestured to her—a silent command to return to the Prince. Without waiting for acknowledgment, he entered the throne room, slipping around the perimeter to reach Bolvar Fordragon.
With one last glance at her sister, flanked by Bryna and Jaina Proudmoore near the room’s main entrance, Kamery complied. A hint of sulfur wafted over her as a black dragonspawn rushed by in the opposite direction, hurrying to aid his mistress in the throne room. He didn’t see Kamery as she clung to the shadows.
Pausing for a moment outside the study door, she coated her daggers in the poisons that she always had at the ready. While her priority was to reach the Prince, she did not want to bring out the noxious substances in his presence. She hoped that Anduin would remain safe in his study, but she would be foolish not to be prepared.
Despite the chaos beginning to erupt outside, the study was a warm haven of peace. Broll leaned easily against the wall to the right of the doorway, indulgently watching as Anduin played with Elthas, who was in feline form.
At Kamery’s entrance, Broll straightened, alerted, but then relaxed when he recognized her. Anduin’s laugh rang out as the young prince chased Elthas around the room. Beneath her bandanna, Kamery felt herself smile at the youthful innocence as she closed the door behind her.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Kamery receives terse letter from Shaw &quot;Come home on {appropriate holiday}&quot;
- Knows he means the cottage she and Caro grew up in, now deserted, in Elwynn Forest
- Kamery remembers childhood and parents' deaths</Synopsis>
            <Text>The return trip across the smoldering wasteland of the Burning Steppes had been uneventful. As Kamery watched Varian and Windsor stride across the rough encampment to speak with Marshal Maxwell, Helendis Riverhorn approached her.
The Kaldorei warrior held out a sealed missive, and Kamery’s eyes narrowed at the thought of being asked to deliver another message. However, this particular letter was for her—another concise and cryptic communication from Mathias Shaw.
Broll had followed Varian and Windsor, and was watching the low, intense conversation now taking place between the two and Maxwell. Raynn and Bryna stood nearby, engaged in a light debate about the values of various gems and ores. Kamery idly wondered how long it would take Bryna to suggest selling the invaluable dark iron ingots.
With Carolyn and Elthas listening, Kamery read out Shaw’s note. “‘Kamery, Carolyn. Harvest Festival is a time to gather at home with friends, both new and old.’”
Carolyn’s eyes widened at the mention of her own name. “What does he mean, gather at home? Does he want us to return to Stormwind?”
“Friends old and new,” Elthas mused. “The five of us, with Broll and Varian? Does he know about Windsor?”
Kamery’s shoulders lifted in uncertainty. She did understand one part of the message though. “Not to Stormwind.” She watched Carolyn’s face. “Addressed to both of us—he means our cottage.”
Carolyn had left for Darnassus not long after their parents’ deaths, and Kamery didn’t think her sister had returned to the cottage since. The priestess drew in a long, shaky breath, confirming Kamery’s suspicions. Elthas shifted subtly closer in a silent show of support.
As Carolyn absorbed the hidden meaning, Kamery took a moment for her own memories. They had been born and grown up in Elwynn Forest, just southwest of Stormwind. Although simple, their parents’ cottage had been warm and homey. A small garden patch had provided them vegetables, and they had owned a pair of cows and some chickens, which had provided milk and eggs to sell in nearby Goldshire.
The twin sisters had been schooled at home by their mother, until they had reached fifteen. Although most of their free time had been spent helping tend to the small farm, they had been happy and loved. At fifteen, Kamery had been accepted by SI:7, to begin training as a rogue; Carolyn had begun her studies at nearby Northshire Abbey.
Unfortunately, their parents’ pride had been short-lived, as they had both contracted a wasting sickness not long afterwards.
Despite the best efforts of the priests and clerics, both from Northshire and Stormwind itself, both parents had died within days of each other, just before the girls’ eighteenth birthday. They had been too ill to see Carolyn don the robes of a full priestess, and had not known that Kamery had become a proper agent within SI:7.
Kamery swallowed with difficulty, seeing Carolyn’s eyes misting over as her sister relived the same memories. Gently laying his large hands on both of their shoulders, Elthas drew the two sisters into a three-way embrace.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Bryna discovers the Caverns of Time while exploring Tanaris
- Sent by Bronze Dragonflight to protect Medivh opening the Portal</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meanwhile in Tanaris, Bryna floated just above the sand on her new magic carpet. The sun was still rising, midway up the sky in the east, but already she could feel the heat rising from the sand as she looked out over the dunes. She took a moment to admire her latest creation. Woven from black wool, with red and gold silk accents, the carpet rippled gently at its edges, although the center where she stood stayed fairly stable, even when she moved. She smiled at the memory of acquiring the pattern.
“This isn’t the end,” she had told Kamery. She had meant of their friendship, but was more than happy to apply the idea to trading also.
Fitch smiled, a smug, self-satisfied expression, as she turned back to him, and her heart sank. He had something interesting. She made a mental tally of her gold. She did have quite a bit, but Elthas’s suggestion of buying a horse had been a good one, and horses weren’t cheap.
Curiosity won, and she stepped back to the podium to see what Fitch had to offer.
Quietly, he slipped her a rolled up scroll beneath the podium. Glancing down, she noted that it was a tailoring pattern. One that called for alarming amounts of silk and wool. As she read what it would create though, her eyes snapped back up to Fitch.
“How much?” She flinched; her voice had been a gasp.
Fitch’s smile grew. He knew that she would pay whatever he asked.
In the end, the price had been reasonable—not much more than the cost of the horse that she no longer needed. She had finally completed the carpet during her recent visit to Theramore, and had used it to explore most of Tanaris over the past few days, while Raynn had honed her blacksmithing craft.
A Troll ruin to the west had seemed intriguing, but that it was filled with undead Trolls. Further west and south, the buzzing of insects had deterred her from going further. She hated bugs. To the south, the desert stretched seemingly endlessly until the golden sands swept up against impassible mountains. Due east, she knew, was the town of Steamwheedle Port. But to the southeast, she hadn’t explored those mountains yet.
Mind made up, Bryna shifted her weight, sending the enchanted rug drifting forwards across the sands. She extended her arms briefly to steady herself. The sensation of her floor moving around her feet was still strange, but she much preferred the elegant carpet to the jolting and saddle sores that would come with a horse.
The mountains rose up ahead faster than she had expected, and closing the distance, Bryna saw now that the small range was split by a valley leading almost due east up the middle. The ground sloped upwards gently into the cleft leading into the valley, and at the far end, she saw the darkness of a cave.
As she nudged her carpet up the apparently empty vale, a sudden roar overhead startled her. The thunderous sound echoed off of the steep cliffs to either side, shattering the quiet peace. Her exploratory curiosity gave way to chagrin. Too late, she realized that she hadn’t exactly been paying attention to her surroundings. Pushing away the pang of self-reproach, Bryna brought a frost-bolt spell ready to mind. Looking up to find the threat, she felt a shiver—completely unrelated to her spell—run through her, chilling her blood with shocked awe.
Overhead, the sun shimmered off glinting scales that mirrored the color of the sand and stone. A pair of bronze dragons arrowed directly down towards her. Their broad, leathery wings, tipped with razor-sharp talons, rustled like autumn leaves as they swept through the air. Long snouts, their mouths lined with fangs, led their streamlined forms. Their legs were tucked back as they dove, closing the distance with swift grace. The spell faded from her mind as she grappled with the new threat.
Her heart pounded as she tried to bring to mind a spell that might help. Invisibility; I need to learn that one soon. Her fruitless efforts were interrupted by a deep, resonant voice sounding from ahead of her, commanding, “Let her pass.” The dragons broke off, circling away just below the peaks surrounding the valley.
Bryna looked up to see a massive dragon, similarly colored but far larger than those still circling overhead, emerging from the cavern. Walking at his side was a slender, blonde-haired Quel’dorei. Her delicate beauty was enhanced by a form-fitting, embroidered gown of lightweight, shimmering silk that matched the hue of the dragons’ scales. The intricate needlework was obviously filled with magic, but Bryna didn’t recognize any of the enchantments. The dragon stopped just outside the cave entrance, but the Quel’dorei continued, to stand before Bryna.
The blonde female studied Bryna for a moment, then glanced back over her shoulder. “Is she the one?”
Bryna’s head tilted in curiosity, as she returned the perusal from beneath the brim of her hat. She’d never met a Quel’dorei before, although she could see the similarities to the more familiar Kaldorei. She’d certainly never met anyone who spoke to dragons before. Startled, she realized that the deep voice had been the dragon, as he spoke again. Her eyes darted between the two in front of her, entranced by the novelty of the experience.
“Yes,” rumbled the dragon. “She will help us.” His faceted eyes gleamed red as they fixed on Bryna, but his unthreatening posture reinforced his words. Supported by four muscular legs with claws digging into the sand under his feet, his heavy body was relaxed. His head had lowered to bring his eyes closer to her level.
The Quel’dorei looked back at Bryna, a polite smile softening her face. “Greetings, Bryna. I am Soridormi, prime consort of Nozdormu, Aspect of the Bronze Dragonflight. This is Anachronos, leader of the brood of Nozdormu.” With a graceful movement of her hand, she gestured towards the imposing bronze dragon. “Of course, you know none of us yet, but we will explain. Please, come with us.”
With the three dragons looming over her, Bryna didn’t see that she had much choice. But, not in any immediately apparent danger, she was intrigued. How did they know my name? What did they mean, the one? I’ll help them? With what? Bronze Dragonflight? Nozdormu? And how was her dress made? Her mind bubbled with questions; curiosity, rather than intimidation, prompted her steps forward.
Bryna followed the bronze dragon into the cavern, eager for the promised explanation. The unassuming cave opened out into a wide passageway, that led in twisting spirals downwards. Sand continued to cover the ground in a thin layer, crunching lightly underfoot as they walked. Ropes of colorful energy began to emerge from the tunnel walls and ceiling, twisting together to light their way, with loose threads and eddies fluttering at their edges.
The tunnel was wide enough for Anachronos to stroll comfortably ahead of her and Soridormi; the massive dragon could have flown, had he wanted. As they reached the edge of the sunlight, he glanced back over his shoulder with a fang-filled expression. Although it could have been frightening, Bryna’s familiarity with Elthas’s feline smiles made her shoulders relax. Reassured, the mage returned her attention to the dragon’s Quel’dorei companion.
“This”—Soridormi indicated her body—“is my visage, to facilitate communication with the mortal races. I am also of the Bronze Dragonflight.”
Bryna’s eyebrows rose in surprise. She hadn’t known that dragons could assume other forms. Then again, she hadn’t known much at all about dragons. Until now, her only other experience had been the recent encounter with the firemane drake on Alcaz Island—that she knew of, she realized, with a sideways glance at the Quel’dorei beside her. Her heart thudded at the thought, although she wasn’t sure if it was from trepidation, or excitement. I suppose it depends what their motivation is.
As they descended, the air cooled, with a light breeze blowing up from further down. Tucking her hair securely behind her long, pointed ears, Soridormi continued, “We are charged with protecting the history of Azeroth.”
Bryna’s head tilted to one side, her eyes unfocusing briefly as she absorbed the information. Different dragonflights—how many are there anyway?—have specific responsibilities? I wonder what the Black Dragonflight—
Soridormi broke into Bryna’s thoughts, her eyes narrowing as she spoke. “Recently anomalies have begun to appear in the time-ways, disrupting the proper flow of history.” Her tone was disapproving. “While we are dealing with the threats as quickly as we can, they are increasing in number, endangering all of time.”
Questions drifted in and out of Bryna’s mind, twisting around like the strands of light overhead. Time-ways? Anomalies? History disrupted? All of time endangered? She found herself unable to piece together a coherent sentence, and frowned at the uncharacteristic feeling.
“It is a lot to take in, I know.” Soridormi offered a sympathetic smile. “But Anachronos has seen that you will be of great assistance to us. We came to greet you when he told of your impending arrival.”
Wryly, although somewhat disconcertingly, Bryna realized that whatever they asked of her, she would agree—otherwise they wouldn’t have been there to meet her. Although she still wasn’t certain what Soridormi meant by anomalies in time-ways, the concept did sound fascinating.
A thrill ran through Bryna at the possibility of visiting other times—perhaps even Dalaran, before it became a zombie-filled crater. ‘Time-ways’—that sounded specific though. Perhaps they’re more like portals, only connecting to certain paths. A shame, but even so… I’ve always avoided history books as too boring; after all bygone events are—usually—already finished. But to have access to living history! Her lips curved upwards at the thought.
As Bryna pondered the possibilities, the import of the revelations beginning to sink in, they reached the bottom of the winding tunnel. The passageway opened out into a vast cavern. The ropes of light overhead soared upwards, joining others to form ribbons of multicolored energy that festooned the high ceiling and illuminated the spacious chamber. Bryna took a deep breath of the cool air, smelling the dry, dusty scent of the sand that still crunched and shifted under their feet.
A large platform dominated the open central area, its outer edge decorated with carved symbols that Bryna didn’t recognize. A massive, stylized hourglass stood in the center of the dais, the sands within shifting up and down at random intervals. Anachronos took flight now, to glide up and settle beside the hourglass. His sparkling eyes still watched Bryna though, seeming to see everything she did, had done, or would do.
More tunnel openings led out from the central chamber, each one twisting out through its own little landscape. Nearby were a thick spruce forest, a bleak, grey desert, and a deserted street in a Human city. In the distance, Bryna could glimpse even more varied terrains.
“Each of these”—Soridormi gestured to the miniature landscapes—“is a different time-way, each leading to a point in history that needs our attention. If any of these time-ways collapses, the world as we know it will end.”
Bryna looked around, her eyes widening at the number. In some of the landscapes, she could see three or four tunnels branching off. Well, that answers that question—they are specific connections. Even so…so much history, being threatened? How? “What is causing the anomalies?”
As she answered, Soridormi guided them past the deserted city street, towards one of the further passageways. “Our foes call themselves the Infinite Dragonflight.” Her fine, blonde brows drew together and her lips tightened. “We don’t know where they came from, or what their purpose is.”
They reached the time-way, which was surrounded by a musty, brown-green swamp. Stunted trees covered with moss and lichen lined a muddy pathway, eerily lit by a ribbon of pink light winding through their branches. The damp air, a stark contrast to the dry desert, reminded Bryna of Dustwallow Marsh. Bryna took another deep breath to fortify her overloaded mind; the earthy smell wasn’t as refreshing as the desert air, but it helped settle her. Another dragonflight.
“This leads to the Black Morass.” The disguised dragon gestured to the tunnel beyond the swamp.
Bryna peered down the pathway curiously. This close, she could see that the passageway quickly disappeared into a pinkish mist. Black Morass…I know I’ve heard that name before, where was it?
Soridormi pressed on, unknowingly answering Bryna’s question. “They plot to destroy the Guardian, Medivh, and prevent the Dark Portal from ever opening.”
The words triggered Bryna’s memory. The Black Morass had been where the Dark Portal had disgorged the Orcish Horde, twenty-five years ago. That Horde had swept across Stormwind’s lands, laying waste to the countryside, and finally destroying the city itself. Six years later—the same year that Bryna had been born—the Wars had ended, but skirmishes between the Human-led Alliance and the Horde continued even to the present day.
Soridormi continued, “While outwardly, this may appear a boon to the forces of the Alliance…” She gave a faint, humorless smile, and Bryna’s mind raced with the implications.
Of course, if the Horde never came through the Portal, Stormwind wouldn’t have been razed. I wonder if I’d even have been born then. So much would change! But that’s not important—even I know that the Horde were instrumental in the victory over the Burning Legion in the Third War. Bryna’s heart clenched at the thought of what would have happened, had they not won that War.
“It is in actuality catastrophic and will result in your world ending,” Soridormi concluded, her eyebrows raising slightly as Bryna nodded along with her proclamation.
The statement was dramatic, but logical—if not for all of the inhabitants of Azeroth, including the Horde, coming together, the demons of the Legion would have overrun and destroyed their world. Her composure starting to return, Bryna admitted, with a wry smile, “Thinking about our history, the Horde and Alliance, is easier than dragons!” 
Soridormi smiled briefly, but then turned to indicate the time-way. “We have an agent, Sa’at, inside already, but the Infinite Dragonflight forces are too many in number. We cannot spare anyone else.”
Looking into the passageway that twisted back into history, Bryna began to understand the enormity of the task of the Bronze Dragonflight. The interplay of events through time is an intricate game of dominoes, and this Infinite Flight seems to be pushing over the wrong pieces. I don’t need Anachronos’s foresight to know that I’ll do whatever I can to help keep history intact.
Straightening her backpack straps on her shoulders, Bryna asked, “What do you need me to do?” She was mildly amused to see that she had actually startled the Quel’dorei dragon with her quick response. Hadn’t Anachronos already predicted that she would help?
“Cross through this time-way, then speak to Sa’at,” Soridormi instructed. “He is attempting to undo the damage, and will need your protection. Medivh must succeed.”
With a nod, Bryna set off down the pathway. If I’m going to spend more time in the company of Bronze Dragons, I’m going to need to adjust my reading priorities. I wonder if Jaina has many history books.</Text>

            <Text>“We must retrieve Ironfoe.” Varian’s firm voice broke the post-battle silence.
“We’ve found Windsor’s notes,” Kamery argued, patting her belt pouch where the notes now rested. “It would be foolish to venture deeper into the heart of the Dark Iron kingdom.”
Varian’s eyes flashed with determination. “It would be foolish to leave such a powerful weapon in the hands of our enemies,” he insisted.
The argument had drawn Raynn’s attention, and she moved closer. “He’s right,” the warrior acknowledged reluctantly. “Ironfoe is legendary, even in Ironforge.”
Kamery frowned beneath her bandanna, but she nodded, accepting defeat. “We go cautiously,” she warned. The warriors both nodded, but she wondered how long that would last.</Text>

</Synopsis>
            <Text>Heading towards Theramore now, Raynn trudged through the tangled undergrowth of northern Dustwallow Marsh. It seemed worse than she remembered, with the damp ground sucking at her iron boots at each step, every movement accompanied by loud squelching and the smell of damp decay. In Ratchet, she had sold off some of her old armor to pay for a horse. The mount had sped her way down the coastline of the Barrens. Unfortunately, upon entering the swamp she had found that it was faster to proceed on foot.
Her weary eyes caught a glimmer of white stone ahead, giving her hope that her trek was almost at an end. Watchtowers lined the road leading to Theramore, she knew, and hopefully the road was still in good repair so she could ride the rest of the way into town.
The guards at the tower gave Raynn a curious glance as she emerged from the swamp, but otherwise paid her no heed when she turned onto the road. Calling her brown horse once more, she mounted and rode southeast.
Before long, Theramore’s main gate came into view. Raynn felt a brief moment of panic as the old feeling of rejection rose up, but taking a deep breath of the crisp, briny air, she quelled it with her newfound resolve. She knew that Jaina had sent her away for her own protection and growth; she knew now that it hadn’t been personal. Four years later, fully grown and better trained, she knew she was more than capable of protecting herself.
Passing into the familiar town, she wondered if much had changed in the time she had been gone. The tower was still there, a solid, comforting presence in the middle of town. The travelers’ inn stood to the left of the entrance, warm light spilling from its windows. No longer a resident of the town, she would be  staying there tonight; previously she had lived in the other inn, near the docks, but it was for townspeople only.
Beside that other inn, beyond the blacksmith’s, stood the stable, so Raynn directed her horse in that direction. As she passed the the rounded building that housed the forge, a tumult of emotions and memories flooded through her, swirling and drifting like the smoke rising from the forge’s wide chimney.
Almost five years ago, she had first come to Theramore, still recovering from injury. After enduring two months of healer-enforced inactivity, she had recovered enough to work a forge, but the town’s blacksmith had refused to apprentice her. The smith, Marie, had deemed her too young, but Raynn, at almost fifteen, had been a full year older than the lad Marie had taken on only a few days later. Knowing that her Dwarven training had surpassed the boy’s knowledge, Raynn had been frustrated and furious.
As she brought her horse to the open-fronted stables, Raynn patted the sturdy animal, settling it in to one of the stalls. The rhythmic thuds of steel on wood echoed from the training yard of the citadel across town. The sound brought back memories of pouring out her turbulent adolescent feelings into the wooden training dummies, when she had finally been allowed to resume combat training.
Her muscles tensed and flexed lightly, echoing the movements that ran through her mind. The soldiers of the garrison had been appalled at the barrage of blows, calling it a loss of control, but every movement had been precise and balanced, practicing the techniques learned from Grom Hellscream.
Raynn turned back along the road, retracing her steps past the blacksmith’s. She brushed off her memories of Marie just as easily as the crisp, rustling straw had brushed the remnants of the dark mud off her boots. Memories of Grom, however, were not so easy to dismiss, and she felt her throat tighten at the thoughts of her one-time protector and mentor. Bound by a blood oath to protect her, he had fought fiercely against the bloodlust in her presence.
Not long before they had sent her away to Stormwind, Thrall had told her of Grom’s sacrifice. She had still been unconscious from her injury when he had freed himself, and all of the Orcs, from Mannoroth’s control, using the last of his strength to destroy the pit lord. Despite her grief, her heart lightened at the knowledge that he had died reclaiming the honor that he had always shown her.
Avoiding the dark path begun by thoughts of Grom’s honor, Raynn forced her thoughts back to Theramore as she turned up the path towards the tower entrance. Her fingers brushed over the scar on her side, a reminder of the injury that had brought her into Jaina’s care. She wondered what might have happened to her if she hadn’t been hurt, but Thrall had been right; she would never have found a home among the Horde.
Theramore’s soldiers, at least, had taken her in and taught her, she realized, with one last, dismissive glance at the smithy. And the Dwarves in Ironforge had taught her more about blacksmithing than she ever would have learned here; she was certain that her skill surpassed Marie’s now. She had learned to move past old resentments, so she turned her attention to the doorway leading into the tower, her steps lightened by her new appreciation of Jaina’s friendship.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Kamery chats with Raynn on the way to Westbrook Garrison.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kamery walked easily through the familiar forest of her homeland as she led the way to the watchtower. The sun, high overhead, shone through the broad leaves of the massive trees, casting dappled shadows on the grass between them. A light breeze from the west carried the scent of fresh water. A wolf howled in the distance.
There had been a certain innocent confusion in Raynn’s eyes. Refreshing, Kamery mused, wondering if she remembered a time when she had been that naive. Then again, Carolyn had always been the one who believed the best of the world. We may be twins, but we couldn’t be more different. The thought of her golden-haired sister brought a smile to Kamery’s face. Breaking her reverie, she focused on her companion.
“So, Raynn, what brings you to Elwynn?” She dropped back to walk beside the warrior, still guiding their direction as they turned west onto the well-worn road. This far from Goldshire, the cobbles were almost indistinguishable from the packed dirt they were embedded in.
“Gold.” The auburn-haired warrior gave a short chuckle. “I’m more than happy to share, though. Thank you.” Her voice, carrying hints of accents that Kamery couldn’t even begin to identify, rang with sincere gratitude.
Kamery smiled as she gestured Raynn onto the trail leading north to the Westbrook watchtower. “You did the hard part. I just stabbed.” My poisons didn’t hurt either. “I could get used to having someone like you around.”
‘Someone like you; don’t be too obvious.’ Mathias Shaw’s training echoed in Kamery’s mind, as she reminisced on the conversation they’d had just a few weeks earlier.
“She’s not from around here. Keep an eye on her; find out more.” Shaw stood at the window of the SI:7 headquarters, looking out. The young female warrior was at one of the training dummies on the lawn below, practicing her fighting movements with clean precision.
“Is she a concern?” Kamery asked curiously. Although lean and muscular, the woman looked innocent enough.
“No.” Shaw frowned. “A mystery.”
That, Kamery knew, was even worse than a threat. Those, Shaw had the tools to deal with readily enough.
Keeping Shaw’s instructions in mind, Kamery pulled her thoughts back to the present as Raynn gave a short laugh. “Likewise.”
“So,” Kamery let a mischievous note enter her voice, “you’d be up for more?”
The warrior chuckled again, but she shook her head, setting her ponytail to swaying. “I need to get back to Stormwind. Need to make the rest of the set for these.” She kicked up one foot, clad in a solid iron boot.
The freely moving hair caught Kamery’s attention. “Don’t you wear a helm?” She didn’t need to feign curiosity with this question. Watching Raynn practice, she had noticed that the warrior’s head was always bare. While she preferred keeping her own sight and hearing unhindered with only a bandanna, her understanding of warriors was that they generally covered themselves from head to toe in heavy plate.
Raynn gave a genuine smile, her enthusiasm for the question apparent. With a swift motion, she reached up to her brow and removed something. The moment the light circlet came free, it shimmered into visibility, revealing the layers of magic woven into the golden band. Kamery’s eyes widened at the sight as Raynn held it up. “Enchanted, for protection and invisibility.” Her voice was filled with a mixture of pride and appreciation. Kamery admired the craftsmanship, while simultaneously cataloging the intricate details for future research.
“Where did you get it?” Kamery kept her voice light. “We get visitors from all over, but I can’t quite place your accent.” As soon as she finished, Kamery knew that she had gone too far, too quickly. The tension in Raynn’s body was subtle, but unmistakable.
“From a friend.” Her clipped answer carried an undercurrent of guardedness and, Kamery thought, pain. With a practiced motion, Raynn set the circlet back on her brow, removing it from sight once more. Honest, but not even close to the full picture, Kamery knew. Shaw would be disappointed that she had missed her chance. She was disappointed herself.
Soon, the watchtower came into view, its white stone shining through the broad-leafed trees. Kamery stayed silent as they approached, not pressing Raynn, but allowing the warrior to relax a bit. There had been something in those last words that haunted her—a familiar pain born of loss.
The young warrior harbored more secrets than even Shaw realized, Kamery suspected. She found herself growing to appreciate his tenacity for unraveling mysteries, as she now grappled with an enigma of her own. She would see to it that their paths would cross again.</Text>

            <Title>16-05-16-L0-Riding to the Thandol Span</Title>
            <Text>The wind howled across the rocky terrain as Thrall, Grom, and Raynn rode toward the Thandol Span. The scars of battle were still fresh on the landscape, remnants of the recent struggle for freedom. Raynn, her gaze fixed ahead, felt a mixture of sorrow and determination. Grom, at her side, observed her in silence, while Thrall rode slightly ahead, focused on the path ahead.

Thrall turned to Raynn, his eyes reflecting the weight of their recent losses. &quot;Raynn, I know this journey has been difficult for you. We've faced tragedy, but we must press on.&quot;

Raynn nodded, her grip tightening on the reins. &quot;I understand, Thrall. My parents... they fought for a better future. I won't let their sacrifice be in vain.&quot;

Grom grunted in agreement, his orcish features etched with a mixture of sympathy and resolve. &quot;Your parents were brave warriors. They'd be proud of the strength you've shown.&quot;

As they approached the Thandol Span, the ruins of the once-grand structure loomed in the distance. Thrall guided his wolf to a halt, turning to face Raynn. &quot;This span is a symbol of both the past and the future. We must bridge the gap between our peoples and forge a new destiny.&quot;

Raynn met Thrall's gaze, a spark of determination in her eyes. &quot;I'll do whatever it takes to ensure that future, Thrall. For the Horde, for my people, and for my parents.&quot;

Grom nodded approvingly. &quot;That's the spirit, girl.  We'll overcome the challenges ahead, together.&quot;

With a shared understanding, the trio continued their journey, riding toward the Thandol Span and the uncertain future that awaited them. The echoes of their resolve lingered in the air, a testament to the strength forged in the crucible of adversity.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Carolyn misses Kamery as they get their first look at Gadgetzan. Something catches Elthas's attention.</Synopsis>
            <Text>There was no way Kamery would reach her here, Carolyn thought, bringing her gaze to the dusty brown-walled town below them. As they started down the winding path towards the desert floor, Carolyn studied the buildings within the walls. They seemed low, even for a Goblin-built town. A cluster of smaller buildings to the right suggested houses, perhaps. To the left, several larger buildings seemed to be businesses, and hopefully an inn.
Next to her, Elthas suddenly stopped. Startled, Carolyn drew her mount to a halt, watching the druid curiously as he shifted to his panther form and stared at the open area on the far side of the town. At this distance, she couldn’t make out much, but she knew that the panther’s vision was many times better than her own.</Text>

            <Title>Interrogation</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Isolating and questioning a Dark Iron Dwarf</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kamery turned to Raynn. “We need one Dark Iron. Preferably one who looks knowledgeable, and talkative.” With a stern look, she emphasized, “Talkative.” Turning to Varian, Kamery fixed the hotheaded King with a piercing look. “Stay.”
Varian stared at the rogue for a moment, and Raynn almost laughed. She often felt the same desire to charge headlong into combat, to revel in the immediacy and pure physicality. Working with a group however, had advantages, not the least of which was a variety of tactics and approaches. Kamery and SI:7 were the experts on gathering information, and she deferred to the rogue’s judgment.
Apparently Varian reached the same conclusions, and he nodded sharply, although his eyes narrowed with impatience. Raynn nodded her understanding to Kamery. As quietly as she could, trying to stay in the shadows at the edge of the tunnel, the warrior approached the central chamber, peering in to choose her quarry. Unfortunately, the Dark Irons all seemed rather sociable, and none were alone.
“Two would work,” Bryna whispered from behind her, surprising her; she hadn’t noticed the mage move.
With a nod, Raynn chose a pair of Dark Irons not far from the entrance. Pulling a throwing knife from her belt, she drew their attention. Predictably, they charged at the interloper as she ducked back around the corner. Rounding the corner into the tunnel, one almost immediately grunted in surprise as it was magically transformed into a turtle.
The other Dark Iron followed Raynn through the short tunnel as she backed down to the antechamber. Her shield easily blocked his attacks, which barely faltered, even as he realized that he was surrounded by seven opponents, not one.
Another spell from Bryna froze his feet in place. Raynn moved away to give him room to calm down. Thankfully, Varian and Broll also stood down, watching quietly as Kamery approached the Dark Iron, her poison-edged daggers casually in hand.
“I won’t tell you nothing,” the Dark Iron snarled.
Carolyn joined her sister, Shadowy tendrils wreathing her arms and head. “Tell her, or tell me.”
The Dark Iron caved, revealing the location of the two that they sought and even telling them that Ironfoe, Windsor’s weapon, had been taken by Emperor Dagran Thaurissan to the Imperial Seat in the heart of the city. He sneered that his information would do them no good though, since the entrance to the gatehouse was magically locked; not even Kamery’s lock-picks would open it.
Smiling grimly, Varian held up the key they had retrieved from Forgewright’s tomb. “Perhaps this will unlock it.”
The Dark Iron paled, and then collapsed as Broll struck him from behind with one massive paw.</Text>

            <Title>A Way Home</Title>
            <Text>Lily and Anduin embarked on a quest through the unfamiliar streets of Lily's world, their search for a way back to Azeroth guiding their steps. The contrast between the bustling city and the medieval elegance of Anduin's Stormwind weighed on his mind. His keen eyes darted around, taking in the sights and sounds with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.

As they traversed the urban landscape, Lily filled Anduin in on the complexities of her world—the internet, smartphones, and the intricacies of contemporary life. Anduin listened intently, fascinated by the advancements but also yearning for the familiar embrace of Stormwind's stone walls.

&quot;I must admit, Lily, your world is a marvel, but I find myself missing the simplicity of Azeroth,&quot; Anduin confessed, his thoughts drifting to the lands and people he was duty-bound to protect.

Lily patted him on the shoulder, a comforting gesture. &quot;Don't worry, Anduin. We'll figure this out. There has to be someone or something that can send you back to your realm.&quot;

Their search led them to an eccentric inventor who claimed to have expertise in interdimensional travel. The inventor, a wild-haired enthusiast named Dr. Evelyn Sparks, examined Anduin with a mix of excitement and skepticism.

&quot;And you're really from another world? This is amazing!&quot; Dr. Sparks exclaimed, her eyes widening.

Anduin nodded solemnly. &quot;Indeed. I seek a way to return to Azeroth and fulfill my responsibilities.&quot;

Dr. Sparks scratched her head, pondering the possibilities. &quot;Well, I've never sent anyone to another dimension before, but I'm up for the challenge. We just need the right tools and a bit of luck.&quot;

As Lily and Anduin assisted Dr. Sparks in assembling a makeshift portal device, Anduin couldn't shake the anticipation building within him. The prospect of returning home, reuniting with his allies, and continuing his mission fueled his determination.

As the portal crackled with arcane energy, Anduin exchanged a grateful glance with Lily. With a deep breath, he stepped through, leaving behind the urban landscape of Lily's world for the familiar landscapes of Azeroth. The swirling energies enveloped him, and for a moment, he was suspended between worlds.

Then, with a burst of light, Anduin found himself back in Stormwind, the comforting embrace of Azeroth welcoming him home.</Text>

            <Title>32-01-L100-Bad News</Title>
            <Text>Raynn approached Anduin with a heavy heart, her eyes reflecting the weight of the news she carried. &quot;Anduin, we need to talk. It's about your father, Varian.&quot;

Anduin looked up from his map, concern etching his youthful features. &quot;What happened? Is my father all right?&quot;

Raynn sighed, choosing her words carefully. &quot;Varian gave everything to hold back the Legion. He fought with unmatched courage, but the cost was too high. I'm sorry, Anduin, but your father didn't make it.&quot;

Anduin's eyes widened, disbelief and grief washing over him. &quot;No... Varian...&quot;

Raynn nodded, placing a reassuring hand on Anduin's shoulder. &quot;I know this is a lot to take in. Varian admired you greatly, believed in your potential to lead. He spoke of you often during our time on Draenor.&quot;

Anduin, struggling to process the news, whispered, &quot;Draenor... he was there with you?&quot;

Raynn nodded again, memories of their fleeting connection lingering in her mind. &quot;Yes, he visited the garrison frequently. We... we became close during those visits.&quot;

Anduin's expression shifted, a mix of sorrow and understanding. &quot;I had no idea. Thank you for telling me, Raynn.&quot;

Raynn met his gaze, her voice filled with sincerity. &quot;Anduin, your father's legacy lives on. He entrusted you with the future. I believe in your ability to lead and honor his memory.&quot;

Anduin, his eyes reflecting newfound determination, nodded. &quot;I won't let him down. We'll stand united against the Legion, for Azeroth and for my father.&quot;

Raynn offered a solemn smile. &quot;That's the spirit, Anduin. We'll face this together. For the Horde and the Alliance.&quot;

As they stood there, the weight of Varian's sacrifice lingered, but a resilient hope began to emerge in the face of the challenges ahead.
~~~
Raynn made her way through the bustling streets of Stormwind, the weight of recent events heavy on her shoulders. The news she carried was grim, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility to share it with Anduin as soon as possible. The young king was in his study, surrounded by advisors and maps detailing the Legion's invasion.

Anduin looked up as Raynn entered, his usual calm demeanor softening with a hint of concern. &quot;Raynn,&quot; he greeted, &quot;you look troubled. What news do you bring?&quot;

Raynn took a deep breath, steeling herself for the difficult conversation ahead. &quot;Anduin, we need to talk. It's about your father.&quot;

Anduin's eyes narrowed, his expression turning serious. &quot;What happened? Is Varian okay?&quot;

Raynn hesitated for a moment before speaking. &quot;Anduin, I'm sorry. Varian... he's gone. He fell in battle against the Legion.&quot;

A heavy silence filled the room as Anduin absorbed the shock of the news. Raynn could see the pain in his eyes, the weight of loss settling in. She waited for him to respond, giving him the time he needed.

Finally, Anduin spoke, his voice steady despite the grief. &quot;Thank you for telling me. I... I appreciate your honesty.&quot;

Raynn nodded, her gaze sympathetic. &quot;I was there, Anduin. I fought alongside him. He was a great leader, and he went down fighting, protecting us all.&quot;

Anduin sighed, his shoulders slumping as he processed the reality of his father's death. &quot;I never expected... I always thought he was invincible in a way. But I suppose no one truly is.&quot;

Raynn reached out, placing a comforting hand on Anduin's shoulder. &quot;He believed in you, Anduin. He spoke of you with pride and hope for the future. You're not alone in this. The Alliance needs you now more than ever.&quot;

Anduin nodded, appreciating the gesture of support. &quot;Thank you, Raynn. I'll do my best to honor his legacy.&quot;

Raynn squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. &quot;I know you will. Varian's spirit will live on in you, and I'll be here to help in any way I can. We've faced challenges before, and we'll face this one together.&quot;

Anduin managed a small, grateful smile. &quot;I'm glad to have you by my side, Raynn. Let's rally the Alliance and stand strong against the Legion. For Azeroth, and for my father.&quot;

The two shared a moment of shared determination, knowing that the road ahead would be difficult but that they would face it united against the threat of the Burning Legion.</Text>

            <Title>Blood Oath - Grom</Title>
            <Text>In the shadow of a battered tent, Grom Hellscream stood tall, his brow furrowed as the weight of his recent actions settled upon him. Before him lay the lifeless forms of Ellis and Lysandra, a grim tableau of the cost of liberation. Thrall's questioning gaze bore into him, demanding an explanation for the mercy killings.
&quot;They were near death, Thrall,&quot; Grom grumbled, his voice heavy with the burden of the recent events. &quot;Beaten. I offered the man a quick end. Before he died, he made me swear to find and protect his child.&quot;
Thrall's expression shifted to a mix of concern and skepticism. &quot;A child, Grom? In the midst of our war-band? It is no place for a human. They won't survive among us. We are on a mission to liberate our people.&quot;
But Grom, anchored by the weight of a promise, held firm. &quot;Thrall, it's a matter of honor. A blood oath. I won't break it.&quot;
As Thrall hesitated, Grom's thoughts delved into the gravity of the situation. The blood oath weighed heavily on his conscience, a solemn commitment made in the midst of suffering. &quot;A blood oath, Thrall,&quot; he reiterated, knowing that such pledges were not to be taken lightly.
Thrall, acknowledging the solemnity of the oath, finally relented. &quot;Very well, Grom. But the risks are great. We must be cautious.&quot;
As they rode towards the Thandol Span, Grom's mind echoed with the echoes of the orcish code of honor. The promise to protect Raynn reverberated within him, a pledge forged in the crucible of war, setting the course for a journey fraught with uncertainty and duty.

            <Title>Revelations</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Shaw tells them that Anduin was attacked recently, and 'King Varian' saved him, and now Anduin has lost his doubts about his father; but 'King Varian' is also spending more time with Katrana Prestor and seems enamored with her.
- Jaina tells them that she has figured the spell out, and Varian was actually split into two people; the Varian in Stormwind has had his will and resistance removed, and is susceptible to Onyxia's influence
- They confront General Marcus Jonathan at the gates of Stormwind; Jonathan was ordered not let them in, but he knows Windsor, so he does.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Jaina spoke, Bryna moved to the left of the door and leaned against the wall near the hearth. From below the brim of her hat, she studied the assembled group as they settled in. Her friends, already well-known to her, were presently secondary to the others seating themselves around the table.
Bryna didn’t think it was by chance that Shaw sat across from the door, facing the opening. At his right, Varian sat closest to Bryna, with his back to the hearth. Jaina sat near where she had descended, across from the King. Across from Shaw, Marshal Windsor took the final chair, looking every inch the Stormwind soldier he was, in his recovered armor and with Ironfoe hanging from his belt.
Broll took up a post on the other side of the door from Bryna, with Raynn beside him. Kamery and Carolyn had moved to the back of the room, standing across from Bryna on the other side of the hearth. Elthas stood nearby, and Bryna noticed Shaw shift slightly, so that the druid remained in his peripheral vision.
She knew that he trusted them, yet habits were hard to break; the man did not like to miss anything. A self-deprecating smirk teased her lips, as she noted her own position and observations.
“Thank you, Shaw.” Varian nodded to the spy-master, before turning to Jaina. “What have you discovered since we last parted? Time is of the essence, and we need to know what we are up against. We must confront the impostor and rid Stormwind of the Black Dragonflight influence.”
“I’m afraid it’s not that simple,” Jaina shook her head regretfully. “The man on the throne now is not an impostor.” Her declaration sent shock around the room, eliciting more than one sharp inhalation. Standing a bit straighter herself now, her attention heightened, Bryna saw Varian’s face harden with anger and denial.
Jaina forestalled his protest with an upraised hand as she continued. “I believe that I have found the spell that was used on Alcaz Island.” She cast a glance at Bryna and her friends; their investigations had uncovered the rune circle used in that spell. “The spell was meant to remove certain traits from its target, but it backfired, and instead created two distinct individuals.”
Beyond Varian, Elthas murmured, “The split trails.” From the corner of her eye, Bryna caught Broll’s approving nod as the younger druid’s confusing report was finally explained.
Varian looked from Jaina to the druid and back again in confused disbelief. “Are you saying that I am…half of one man?”
Jaina’s brow furrowed as she tried to explain. “Yes and no. While parts were separated, you have been able to fight past the spell, and live a whole life. The two of you, you are both Varian Wrynn.”
“This complicates matters.” Shaw frowned, adding, “Of late, it seems that Prince Anduin has come to the same conclusion. He has accepted the man on the throne as his father.”
At Shaw’s words, Varian turned to him in protest. “Why would he believe this now? Magni told us that Anduin had doubts.”
Shaw spread his hands in a rare admission of unknowing. “A few days ago, on a hunt, Anduin was unhorsed, and Varian—the other one—saved his life. Since then, Anduin has trusted him.”
Varian’s hands clenched on the table in front of him at the mention of danger to his son. “We must stop this.” He tensed, ready to push back his chair and storm the city immediately.
“Anduin is a perceptive young man,” Raynn broke in, surprising them all, and possibly even herself. As her eyes unfocused with memory, she did not elaborate.
Once again, Bryna wondered exactly what had happened on the warrior’s visit to the throne room so many months ago. She saw her curiosity reflected in the eyes of Elthas and the twin sisters; Raynn had shared much with them of late, but that particular afternoon had never come up.
Shaw’s eyes also lingered thoughtfully on Raynn, even as he reassured Varian. “Anduin is unharmed. Bolvar reports that this other Varian seemed to want to tell them something, but Lady Prestor stopped him. He seems enthralled by her.”
“Lady Prestor,” Windsor interjected, straightening even more in his chair, “is none other than the Black Dragonflight brood-mother herself, Onyxia.” A thread of tension wound through the room at the name. Windsor had already shared this information as they had left the Blackrock Depths, but hearing the name spoken aloud was still chilling.
Shaw’s eyes widened slightly, then narrowed in thought as Jaina nodded slowly. The arch-mage spoke thoughtfully. “That explains a lot. She would have been in position to exert influence over you, manipulating events in Stormwind in her favor. However, as your attachment to Anduin grew, her hold weakened. This spell was her attempt to regain control. Rather than being destroyed, that severed willpower became…you.”
“Without willpower, the man in Stormwind is vulnerable to Prestor’s manipulations once more, it seems.” Broll frowned.
“We must unmask her and put a stop to this,” Varian insisted once more, slamming his fist down on the table. “Windsor has the proper incantation.” Windsor nodded in confirmation.
“We do not know how deep the Black Dragonflight infiltration has gone,” Shaw warned, one hand angling up in warning. “We must be cautious. Have you discovered the identity of any others, Marshal?”
Windsor shook his head, his shoulders slumping slightly. “If there are any, they are likely lesser dragonspawn or drakonids. I only discovered the identity of the one dragon herself.”
As Windsor spoke, Varian’s fists clenched and unclenched on the tabletop in front of him. “Can we rely on Fordragon’s cooperation?” the King asked, his voice tight with impatience. Fordragon’s refusal of aid to Lakeshire had rankled.
Shaw shook his head. “He has moments of doubt, and they seem to be growing, but he is also under her spell, I believe.”</Text>

            <Notes>Jaina reveals that she has found the spell responsible for splitting Varian into two people, emphasizing that the Varian in Stormwind is not an &quot;impostor&quot; but a genuine part of Varian. (Onyxia greatly gained influence over Varian after his wife's death but periodically lost control as Varian's attachment to Anduin grew. Thus she attempted to reassert her control by using a spell that would not kill Varian but would remove and destroy his conscience, will, and responsibility.)</Notes>

            <Title>Sentence Structures</Title>
            <Text>Certainly! Varying sentence structure adds rhythm and flow to your writing. Here are some ways to achieve that:
1. **Simple Sentences:**
   - These are straightforward sentences with one independent clause.
   - Example: Carolyn nodded in agreement.
2. **Compound Sentences:**
   - Combine two independent clauses using a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or), a semicolon, or a colon.
   - Example: Carolyn nodded in agreement, and Kamery gestured to the bartender.
3. **Complex Sentences:**
   - Combine an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses.
   - Example: While Carolyn nodded in agreement, Kamery gestured to the bartender.
4. **Compound-Complex Sentences:**
   - Combine two independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
   - Example: While Carolyn nodded in agreement, Kamery gestured to the bartender, and Mikhail, though unfamiliar with the name 'Slim,' offered his assistance.
5. **Parallel Structure:**
   - Present similar ideas using the same grammatical structure.
   - Example: Carolyn was determined to find answers, to uncover the truth, and to confront the growing threat.
6. **Inverted Sentences:**
   - Begin sentences with phrases that don’t follow the standard subject-verb-object order.
   - Example: In agreement, Carolyn nodded.
7. **Emphatic Structure:**
   - Place the most important element at the beginning or end of a sentence.
   - Example: It was Mikhail who, despite not recognizing 'Slim,' offered his assistance.
8. **Rhetorical Questions:**
   - Pose questions without expecting a direct answer, adding a rhetorical flair.
   - Example: Would they uncover the truth, or would the growing threat remain hidden?
9. **Short Sentences for Impact:**
   - Use short sentences for emphasis or to create a quick pace.
   - Example: Kamery turned. Carolyn ran. Action ensued.
10. **Descriptive Phrases:**
    - Insert phrases to provide additional details.
    - Example: The inn, warm and inviting, welcomed the weary travelers.
Experimenting with these structures will bring variety to your writing, keeping the reader engaged and enhancing the overall rhythm of your prose.
~~~
Certainly! Here are some tips for incorporating more compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences without making the writing sound unnatural:
1. **Combine Related Ideas:**
   - Look for sentences that express related ideas and consider combining them. This can often be done by using coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or), subordinating conjunctions (although, because, since), or semicolons.
2. **Use Subordinate Clauses:**
   - Introduce subordinate clauses to add complexity to your sentences. These clauses can begin with subordinating conjunctions and provide additional information or context.
3. **Vary Sentence Openings:**
   - Experiment with different ways to begin your sentences. Start with introductory phrases, adverbs, or subordinate clauses to add variety.
4. **Create Compound Sentences:**
   - Connect two closely related independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions or a semicolon. This can help show the relationships between ideas.
5. **Employ Relative Pronouns:**
   - Use relative pronouns (who, which, that) to add information about a noun in your sentence, creating complex structures.
6. **Add Appositives:**
   - Include appositives (noun phrases that rename or explain a noun) to provide additional information in a more complex manner.
7. **Experiment with Punctuation:**
   - Utilize em dashes, colons, and parentheses to add information or create a sense of connection between clauses.
8. **Balance Short and Long Sentences:**
   - Aim for a balance between short and long sentences. Short sentences can be impactful, but longer sentences can convey more complex ideas.
9. **Consider Sentence Purpose:**
   - Match the structure of your sentence to its purpose. Use simpler sentences for clarity and emphasis, and more complex structures for elaboration and nuance.
10. **Read Aloud:**
    - Reading your writing aloud can help you identify areas where sentence structure could be varied or improved. If a sentence sounds awkward or too simple, consider revising it.
Remember, the key is to maintain clarity and coherence while introducing variety. Feel free to experiment and find a balance that suits your writing style and the tone of your piece.

Certainly! &quot;Rhythm and flow&quot; in writing refer to the patterns of sound, structure, and pacing that create a harmonious and engaging reading experience. Here's a breakdown:
1. **Rhythm:**
   - Involves the patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables in words and sentences.
   - Can be influenced by sentence length, the arrangement of words, and the use of punctuation.
   - A well-crafted rhythm can make the text more enjoyable and easier to read aloud.
2. **Flow:**
   - Relates to the smoothness and coherence of the text.
   - Achieved through the logical progression of ideas and the seamless connection between sentences and paragraphs.
   - Transitions, cohesive phrases, and varied sentence structures contribute to a good flow.
3. **Variety:**
   - While simplicity is important, introducing variety prevents monotony.
   - Varying sentence structures, lengths, and styles keeps the reader engaged.
   - It adds a dynamic quality to the writing, preventing it from becoming predictable or dull.
4. **Pacing:**
   - The speed at which the reader moves through the text.
   - Short, punchy sentences can quicken the pace, while longer, descriptive sentences may slow it down.
   - Pacing is adjusted based on the mood or intensity of the scene.
In summary, achieving a good rhythm and flow involves crafting sentences and paragraphs that work well together, creating a pleasant reading experience. It's a subtle art, and finding the right balance depends on the tone, style, and purpose of your writing.

Complex Sentences:
Subordinate Clauses:
Introduce subordinate clauses to add complexity. These clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions (although, because, if, when, etc.).
Example: &quot;While the rain poured outside, Trias stood cross-armed behind a wide counter.&quot;
Relative Clauses:
Use relative clauses (starting with relative pronouns like who, which, that) to provide additional information.
Example: &quot;Trias, who stood cross-armed behind a wide counter, exuded an imposing presence.&quot;
Adverbial Clauses:
Incorporate adverbial clauses to convey circumstances or conditions.
Example: &quot;Trias stood cross-armed behind a wide counter, as if challenging anyone to question him.&quot;
Compound Sentences:
Coordinating Conjunctions:
Employ coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or) to join related independent clauses.
Example: &quot;Trias stood behind the counter, and his right eye was covered by a black leather eye-patch.&quot;
Semicolons:
Use semicolons to connect closely related independent clauses.
Example: &quot;Trias stood behind the counter; his right eye was covered by a black leather eye-patch.&quot;
Conjunctive Adverbs:
Introduce conjunctive adverbs (however, therefore, nonetheless) to connect independent clauses.
Example: &quot;Trias stood behind the counter; however, his right eye was covered by a black leather eye-patch.&quot;</Text>

            <Title>The Return of the King</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Jaina promises to continue investigating through magical means
- Bryna and Kamery portal back to Stormwind to report to Shaw (Bryna goes in hopes that Kamery can return with them)
- Varian is back, having been ransomed by the naga
- Shaw dismisses them, telling Kamery to continue building her skills, but also continue building their group dynamic (he is disappointed that Raynn is no longer around though)</Synopsis>
            <Text>Mounting the steps to the upper tower in the SI:7 headquarters, Bryna briefly questioned her decision to come with Kamery, to report their findings on Alcaz Island. They had hoped that the rogue would be allowed to return with her to Theramore, and they could perhaps fulfill Carolyn’s desire to return to Menethil Harbor, but had she really needed to come all the way to SI:7?
The answer to that question was standing at the window, of course. Bryna had heard about Mathias Shaw before, but only in hints and whispers. Nobody knew much about the man himself, and this was her chance to see him for herself.
Shaw was half-turned, looking out the window still, as Kamery introduced Bryna. He was well-built, beneath his brown and blue-dyed leather, but of average height. With sandy brown hair, a neat mustache and goatee, and nondescript features, she felt that he could walk through the streets of Stormwind in broad daylight, and nobody would bat an eye.
Unless they looked into his eyes, perhaps. Their perceptive gaze turned on Bryna now, and she wished she had kept her head down and her own eyes concealed. She wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of hiding now though. He hadn’t dismissed the wild hat and lightweight vest and leggings, not one bit.
Nodding a greeting, he held up a hand to stop Kamery before she began her report. “Much has changed since you left,” he warned, and his next words left them stunned: “Varian Wrynn has returned.”
Bryna blinked, processing the information, and she could feel Kamery’s confusion beside her.
“How?” Bryna was the first to speak, and it earned her another assessing look from those blue eyes. She was still fitting the pieces together. Elthas had said that the rune circle had been used recently, but exactly how recently? “When?”
Shaw looked at her curiously. “I’m interested to hear your report,” he mused. “Two days ago. He was ransomed by a group of Naga, although the public story is that the Defias were responsible. Lady Prestor handled the matter. You’ve only just missed the celebrations.”
Bryna thought back to their walk through the city. People hadn’t seemed much different—certainly not jubilant enough to have just welcomed back their King.
“The ransom was steep. A new tax was just announced yesterday, to pay for it.” Shaw answered her unasked question.
“What happened on Alcaz Island?” Kamery asked, her tone pensive. She was still working through all the pieces too, Bryna realized, remembering Elthas’s telling of a scent that split in two before leading off the island.
It was Shaw’s turn to be mystified now though, Bryna noted with some satisfaction. “Tell me everything,” he ordered. “Starting with DeLavey.”
Bryna’s attention drifted as Kamery recounted the now-familiar tale, taking the time to look around Mathias Shaw’s office. The round room was moderately sized—large enough for meeting with small groups, but not so large as to be imposing or ostentatious. Windows let in fresh air and sunlight—and gave views of the city outside.
The desk opposite the window Shaw stood at was likewise moderately sized and plainly styled. Papers were stacked neatly on its smooth surface, with one sheet set at an angle in front of the chair, as though he had been midway through writing it when he was interrupted. A nearby quill, its tip still glistening, gave weight to that conclusion.
Had it been their arrival that had interrupted him, Bryna wondered. He had been standing by the window already when they had climbed the spiraling stairs that led directly into the office, but she had no doubt there had been plenty of eyes on them from the moment they had started across the wide lawn. Kamery, of course, would be a familiar sight here, but Bryna knew that her own red hat stood out among the black leather the inhabitants of this building preferred.
The leader of those inhabitants was listening closely to Kamery’s tale now, although his eyes seemed constantly in motion. They moved carefully, casually, not darting about, but they managed to take in the entire office, both women now facing him, and much of the city outside as well, as Kamery spoke.
“We returned to Theramore and told Lady Jaina what we had found.” Kamery was nearly at the end of her tale. Shaw had listened to the whole thing without interruption. “She hadn’t gotten anything more from Hendel.” Her voice was tight at the traitorous private’s mention and Bryna winced in sympathy; Kamery still felt badly about asking Carolyn to force his initial confession.
Kamery concluded, “Lady Jaina sent us back here to report to you. She will continue her investigation, and send word if she uncovers anything, but we reached a dead end.” Her voice reflected her self-indictment for the failure.
Shaw turned to them pensively. “The Naga must have seized Varian from Alcaz. Perhaps left some sort of false trail to confuse pursuers, like your Elthas. Unfortunately, the King doesn’t remember much from his abduction, nor does he want to speak of it.” Shaw’s voice showed a hint of his disgruntlement at that fact. “For now, we must focus on the fact that he has returned.”
 Seeming to notice Kamery’s misery for the first time, Shaw raised an eyebrow at the rogue. “When I sent you to spend some time with your sister,” he began, but then paused briefly. “I knew what DeLavey was investigating of course, but I had no idea you would uncover this much!”
With a brief chuckle, he clapped Kamery on the shoulder. “You’ve done very well. And it sounds as though you and your sister and friends”—his gaze brushed over Bryna—“have come together very well indeed.”
Kamery nodded, her eyes lightening at the mention of the others. Bryna wondered if it was just Carolyn, or if she included Elthas in that pleasure also. The two had only just returned from an incredible infiltration of a heavily-guarded island, and brought back interesting, if mystifying, information.
“Yes, it’s been nice having a diverse group,” the rogue included Bryna with her gaze, and the mage felt a rush of warmth. “We’ve lost track of Raynn though.” Her disappointment returned as she looked back to Shaw. There was something in that look, Bryna thought. Had Kamery’s connection to Raynn been more than a chance meeting?
Perhaps she was reading too much into it though; their group had been a perfect balance, from Raynn’s shield to Carolyn’s healing, from Kamery’s daggers to her frost-bolts, but there would have been no way for Kamery, or even Shaw, to have known that Elthas would accompany Carolyn back from Kalimdor—and even if they had been aware of that year-long friendship, nobody could ever have predicted Elthas’s impulsive invitation to her in Darnassus.
Shaw nodded, regret coloring his features. “She seems to have disappeared for the time being.” Bryna wondered just how closely Shaw had been watching the warrior.
“She said she was going to Ironforge,” she offered, keeping her voice offhand.
“She returned,” the spy-master showed his hand, “then almost immediately left, heading south, into Stranglethorn Vale.” He was watching her carefully now though, she noticed.
Bryna blinked, absorbing that information. Stranglethorn Vale was a wild jungle, filled with vicious wildlife and bloodthirsty Trolls. What could the stoic warrior want there, she wondered. She thought she detected a hint of a smirk beneath Shaw’s thick mustache.
If there had been a smirk, it disappeared as the spy-master spoke again. “Kamery, before you rush off again, I think it would be wise to spend some time with Tony. He has a few new tricks to teach you.”
As Kamery nodded and started down the stairs, Bryna glanced at Shaw. He saw the look and returned it with a smirk.
“Lady Hawthorne, I would be enchanted to have your company while you wait.” The suave spy-master gave a half-bow. Bryna’s amusement bubbled up; she suppressed the chuckle, but felt herself smiling at Shaw’s theatrics.
At his gesture, she crossed to join him at the window. The view was spectacular. From here, she could see all the way across the city, from the Keep to the Cathedral to the Mage Tower.
Shaw seemed to follow her gaze, and he offered her an escape. “Do you need to return to your trainers in the Tower?”
Bryna shook her head, charmed and amused. “No, I learn most of my spells from books these days.”
“Ah, I see. There are a lot of books, aren’t there?” His words made her heart swell at the thought. There were indeed so many books. Shaw chuckled, seeming to read her thoughts again. “You do intend to read them all, don’t you,” he mused.
Bryna nodded, then returned her attention to the man beside her, meeting his perceptive eyes. “Something isn’t right, is it?” she asked, and was satisfied to see a hint of surprise.
Shaw covered his reaction quickly, but he admitted, “I don’t know. It all makes sense, but Varian doesn’t remember anything about his abduction. That alone leaves questions.”
Bryna nodded. “If those questions need answering…” She trailed off. Shaw had an entire organization of covert operatives who could answer those questions, of course, but she was certain there was a reason he was encouraging Kamery’s continued association with Carolyn, Elthas, and herself.
Shaw confirmed her suspicions. “My agents are capable of much, but some tasks require a more…well-rounded group.”
Bryna smirked. “If only we had our shield still. Or perhaps another would do?” She slanted him a questioning look.
Shaw laughed aloud. “Indeed. Raynn intrigues me,” he admitted. Gesturing at the training yard below, he explained, “I first saw her down there. Her fighting style was unusual. So I asked Kamery to find out more.”
Pleased to have gotten a straightforward answer, Bryna filed the information away. She knew little of warrior styles, only that Raynn had been very adept at drawing their enemies’ attention, and Carolyn had seemed to have an easy enough job healing her. So easy that she went in with her staff swinging! She wondered if the warrior would return to Stormwind, or if they would even be here to see it.
As if in answer to her musing, Shaw asked, “What were your plans after this?”
“Carolyn wanted to return to Menethil,” Bryna shrugged. “She said there were people there in need of assistance. It seems as good a place as any to explore and make some coin.”
Shaw’s eyebrows rose, and she wondered if he knew just how much coin she already had. She was quite adept at identifying and selling items of value in the trading houses around the lands. But he only said, “Good. It would behoove the four of you to gain more experience working together.” With another glance out of the window, he added, “Kamery should be about done with Tony now.”
Bryna nodded, accepting the dismissal with a tip of her hat. She caught the sparkle in Shaw’s eyes as she descended the staircase. He was charming and perceptive, and she enjoyed matching wits with him, but she understood now why Raynn had such an aversion to the man.
The aversion was certainly one-sided; Shaw’s disappointment at Raynn’s disappearance had been palpable. Bryna had found the group’s adventures invigorating, fulfilling her need for novelty without her having to run away from friends for once. I wonder how Raynn’s doing. Stranglethorn Vale indeed! They don’t even have any books there.</Text>

            <Text>
Anduin Wrynn, disoriented and clad in his regal armor, walked through the bustling streets of a Canadian city, his eyes filled with a mix of wonder and confusion. The people around him moved swiftly, immersed in their daily lives, oblivious to the displaced prince from another realm.

Approaching a small park, Anduin noticed a woman sitting on a bench, engrossed in a book. Her vibrant red hair stood out against the muted tones of winter, and she wore a friendly, approachable demeanor. Summoning his courage, Anduin approached her.

&quot;Excuse me, fair maiden,&quot; Anduin began, his voice carrying the weight of both regality and uncertainty. &quot;I find myself in a realm unknown to me, and I seek guidance.&quot;

The woman looked up from her book, her green eyes widening with surprise at the sight of Anduin's imposing figure. &quot;Whoa, you're not from around here, are you?&quot; She closed her book, setting it aside.

Anduin shook his head, his golden hair falling slightly over his armored shoulders. &quot;No, I am not. I traversed a rift in the Shadowlands and emerged in this unfamiliar land. I know not its name or its ways.&quot;

The woman studied him for a moment, a mixture of skepticism and curiosity in her gaze. &quot;Okay, this is probably some elaborate cosplay or a movie stunt, but just in case... What's your name?&quot;

&quot;I am Anduin Wrynn, Prince of Stormwind,&quot; he replied, his expression earnest.

A bemused smile tugged at the corners of the woman's lips. &quot;Anduin Wrynn, huh? Sounds like something out of a fantasy novel. I'm Lily. Nice to meet you, Anduin.&quot;

&quot;Likewise, Lily,&quot; Anduin nodded, offering a formal bow. &quot;Might you guide me through this realm? I am lost and seek understanding.&quot;

Lily chuckled, standing up from the bench. &quot;Sure, Anduin. I'll play along. Let's grab a coffee, and you can tell me more about this Shadow-whatever and how you ended up here.&quot;

As they walked toward a nearby café, Anduin marveled at the sincerity in Lily's eyes. A newfound companion in this unfamiliar world, he felt a glimmer of hope that he might navigate the complexities of this modern realm with her help.

            <Synopsis>- Varian/Lo'Gosh and Broll arrive in the Burning Steppes
- Varian jumps in when Caro is soloing a drake (for the hide)
- Caro and Kam recognize him; Raynn doesn't</Synopsis>
            <Text>Standing in the middle of the scorched plains of the Burning Steppes, Raynn watched as Carolyn faced off with a young black drake. The omnipresent scent of ash and heated stone burned her nostrils. However, after years spent in the confines of Ironforge, she had learned to endure it.
An amused smile played on her lips as she remembered the blonde-haired priestess’s insistence on taking on the creature alone. ‘Your blades cut the hides up too much,’ Carolyn had grumbled, shooting accusatory looks at Raynn and Kamery.
Kamery was out of sight now, but Raynn knew that the rogue was hidden somewhere nearby, probably behind the drake, ready to strike if her sister encountered any trouble. Raynn was ready too, watching Carolyn closely. The drake had glanced her way a few times, in her position on the priestess’s right flank, but Carolyn’s staff had drawn its attention.
Suddenly, a clatter of hooves from behind her heralded the arrival of others to the scene and a battle shout rang out over the hissing snarls of the drake. At the unexpected intrusion, Raynn looked over her right shoulder to see a tall Human male rush past her and launch an attack on the drake.
His intrusion startled Carolyn, causing her to lose her footing and stumble awkwardly. Seeing its opportunity, the drake landed a vicious swipe along the priestess’s side. The sharp claws shattered her shield and tore into her robe.
Seeing blood seeping into the white cloth, Raynn growled and charged in herself, between the priestess and the interloper. A peremptory shout and a solid blow from her shield quickly drew the drake’s attention to her. Kamery had also launched herself from the shadows behind the drake, her daggers deftly finding openings between the dark scales.
Under the combined assault, the drake fell quickly. Raynn stood for a moment, letting the battle lust fade from her blood. Beside her, Carolyn’s attention was on the corpse laying on the blackened soil, looking glumly at the now-battered hide. Almost offhandedly, the priestess whispered a holy word to heal her wounds, although the torn robe would need to be mended later that evening.
“It’s ruined,” Carolyn muttered, mourning the drake’s scaled skin as she cast an accusing scowl at the interloper. The moment she looked at him though, the priestess gasped, her eyes opening wide with recognition. Kamery also drew in a sharp breath as she approached from the other side of the corpse.
Confused, Raynn turned to study the man as he turned to face her. He was tall and well-built, with stern features marred by criss-crossing scars—one across the bridge of his nose and another cutting down through one eyebrow and continuing on the cheek below. His long dark hair was pulled back and tied loosely at the top of his head. He wore a leather vest and leggings with plate greaves, a single, spiked pauldron, and a wide belt adorned with the lion of Stormwind on the buckle. Despite the symbol on his belt, nothing else about the man spoke of the city, and Raynn wondered what had drawn such a reaction from the two sisters.
Carolyn and Kamery had shaken off their initial shock and were approaching slowly to stand on Raynn’s left, but their faces were still pale and wide-eyed. Distracted by the twins’ reactions, Raynn barely noticed as the man’s companion, a tall, antlered Kaldorei druid, approached from the other side to complete a small circle.
“What were you thinking?” the man demanded, glaring angrily at Raynn, and she felt her own anger rise in return. “What sort of warrior allows a priestess to be attacked like that?”
Raynn bristled, but before she could respond, Carolyn’s independent spirit overcame her awe, and the priestess came to the warrior’s defense. “I asked her to, to preserve the hide.” The priestess gave a wistful look at the battered drake, before adding, to Raynn’s shock, “Your Majesty.”
Raynn looked at the man again, trying to reconcile the title with what little she knew of Varian Wrynn. Foremost, he looked nothing like his young son. She had only seen him described as tall and handsome; below the scars, this man could be handsome, but he acted, and dressed, more like a barbaric warrior than a king.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Bryna rejoins the group after CoT</Synopsis>
            <Text>Back in Gadgetzan, Raynn reflected that it was good to have friends. Her brief reunion with Jaina had reminded her of that, and spending time with Bryna again had only reinforced it. Their group of five had complemented each other so well, in combat certainly, but also in other ways. She hoped that she could find a way to keep that camaraderie without having to delve too deeply into her past.
Easily picking up the three plates of sizzling chops, Raynn turned to return to her friends. The bright sunlight from the doorway momentarily dimmed, darkened by someone entering the inn. Surprised, she glanced up; she had thought that she and Bryna were the only visitors in town, along with Carolyn and Elthas now, of course.
It was indeed Bryna, unexpectedly early. There was an unusually pensive look in the mage’s dark eyes, but she turned to Dirge as she entered. “Clams please.”
With a good-natured grumble, the Goblin returned to work, tossing clams into a pot of boiling water.
“Bryna! It’s good to see you.” Carolyn smiled at the mage. Her voice was happy, but it also held a hint of concern. “How have you been?”
Raynn set the plates of chops down on the table in front of the three, as Bryna gave a wan smile and sat down.
“It’s been an interesting…morning,” Bryna said. Turning to Raynn, she asked, “Will you be working on your breastplate this afternoon?” At Raynn’s mystified nod, the mage smiled. “I think I’ll watch.”
Raynn chuckled, but her eyes crinkled with concern. Bryna had watched her work for less than an hour their second day here, before declaring the work too repetitive. The mage had quickly exhausted Gadgetzan’s supply of cheap trinkets to practice her enchantment on, but she had seemed satisfied with her progress and had turned to exploring their surroundings.
“Do you know how Kamery is?” Elthas asked the mage.
Bryna shook her head. “We sold the kingsblood first, then she returned to SI:7. I haven’t seen her since.”
The mention of the spy organization made Raynn’s heart tighten, but she pushed the feeling aside as they ate and continue to catch up. She would find a way to make this work, prying rogues or not.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- As they leave the cottage, Carolyn takes a moment
- Varian notices and they have a moment of reflection on loss
- Carolyn warns him not to let Anduin lose his father too</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meanwhile, back at the small cottage in Elwynn Forest, the remaining members of the group stood to filter out of the single room. Flanking the door, Raynn and Bryna exited first, followed by Jaina and Windsor.
On the far side of the room, Carolyn lingered for a moment, looking around once more at her now-abandoned childhood home.
As he reached the door, Varian glanced back at her, and noticed her contemplative look. Crossing the room with a few long strides, he approached her, his face understanding.
“Homecomings can be hard.” The King spoke softly, and Carolyn realized that he didn’t only mean this day. As a boy, he had been uprooted from his home as the population of Stormwind had fled north. Many years later, he had returned to rebuild the city and claim his throne. “As is losing a parent.” He had also lost his parents, at an even younger age than she had, and not much older than his own son was now.
Gratefully, Carolyn smiled up at him. She caught the King’s eyes with hers, seeing the storm of fury building within. “Don’t let Anduin lose his.”
Varian nodded, but his determination didn’t waver. “With your aid.” He included them all in the statement, as he turned to rejoin the others.
As Carolyn followed, she trailed her left hand over the age-smoothed back of the chair where Varian had sat; the same chair that her father had once sat in.</Text>

            <Title>After Hyjal - Raynn</Title>
            <Text>Raynn observed the camp's bustling activity, a blend of wearied warriors and diligent healers. The atmosphere crackled with the aftermath of battle, and a sense of responsibility hung heavy on the air. Amid the makeshift beds, her eyes caught the approach of a woman whose robes hinted at authority.
The woman's gaze settled on Raynn, and curiosity gleamed in her eyes. Raynn straightened, conscious of the plainness of the borrowed clothes that covered her healed wounds. As the woman drew near, a warmth accompanied her smile, easing the tension in Raynn's shoulders.
&quot;Hello there,&quot; the woman greeted, extending a hand. &quot;I haven't had the chance to properly introduce myself. I'm Jaina Proudmoore.&quot;
Jaina Proudmoore—the name echoed in Raynn's mind, a figurehead among those she'd heard of but never met. Wariness lingered, but Raynn reached out to accept the handshake. &quot;I'm Raynn,&quot; she replied, the words cautious yet steady. &quot;Raynn Tanner.&quot;
A subtle recognition flickered in Jaina's eyes, and Raynn couldn't help but wonder how much the woman knew. Jaina's warm smile persisted, an invitation to openness. Raynn's guard held firm but allowed a fraction of curiosity to surface.
&quot;It's a pleasure to meet you, Raynn. You've been through quite an ordeal. How are you feeling?&quot; Jaina inquired.
The question was genuine, but Raynn hesitated, choosing her words carefully. &quot;Better, thank you. Still getting used to being on my feet again.&quot;
Jaina nodded, understanding in her gaze. &quot;Take your time. We've been through a lot, and healing is a process. If there's anything you need or if you'd like to talk, I'm here.&quot;
Raynn offered a nod of gratitude, her eyes following Jaina as she moved through the camp. The encounter left an imprint, a sense of an unspoken story lingering in the air. As Raynn settled back into her surroundings, the curiosity about Jaina and the complexities of the alliance sparked a quiet introspection.</Text>

            <Title>General Angerforge</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Elthas's sense of direction and Raynn's mechanical skill get the gate closed and they go through it
- retrieve Windsor's info from Angerforge and Argelmach
- Dark Iron blacksmithing plans in the Manufactory
- Ironfoe is too dangerous to leave in Dark Iron hands</Synopsis>
            <Text>Giving the confused turtle a confirming glance, Bryna followed Elthas’s lead into the garrison, making sure that the heavy iron door closed behind them. Within, the rough-hewn stone of the outer tunnels gave way to smoothly crafted stonework. Braziers of glowing embers lit the room, filling it with a pungent smoke. Beneath a ramp sloping to the upper level, one wall of the garrison contained bunks for the guardsmen stationed there.
Through the wide, narrow window, they could see the massive open gate that Elthas had described, creating an insurmountable gap in the upper passageway that they needed to cross. However, Raynn nonchalantly activated a mechanism in the middle of the room, setting it to close. It appears she’s picked up a few things from the Gnomes during all those years spent in Ironforge.
Following the others up the ramp, Bryna watched Varian with keen interest, trying to reconcile this furious, almost feral, warrior with her image of the once-noble King of Stormwind. Crowned at a young age after the Second War, Varian had often relied on his generals and advisors.
He had been angered at Stonemasons when their rioting had caused Queen Tiffin’s death, but nothing had hinted at the primal fighter she now witnessed. Gossip at her parents’ shop had painted a different Varian—one marked by deep depression, lost vitality, and diminished passion after the Queen’s demise.
The Varian in front of her now, however, emanated passion as he ferociously battled the Iron Dwarves. Even the minor fire elementals patrolling the garrison were no match. Bryna frowned as yet another foe fell before she could finish casting her frost-bolt spell. With Varian, Broll, Kamery, and Elthas all executing swift melee strikes, she was rarely able to land her slow-casting magic.
As they crossed into the western side of the garrison, the resistance grew stronger. They were closing in on their quarry now, and the generals were well-guarded. Greater fire elementals stood with every group of guards, and Bryna gleefully focused her frost magic on them. As the icy magic pelted the elementals with devastating effect, she smiled in grim satisfaction, pleased to be contributing to their progress.
Like its counterpart on the eastern side of the great gate, the main upper room of the western garrison was a large room for sleeping and relaxation. Bunks lined the walls, while groupings of tables and chairs filled the far side of the room. Ramps led downwards to two sides.
Pausing at the top of a ramp leading down to a room mirroring the gate mechanism room, they spotted their first target, General Angerforge. The sturdy Dark Iron Dwarf was deep in conversation with five underlings, so Bryna hoped they would take a moment to strategize. Her hopes were dashed by the hotheaded warriors though. Both Raynn and Varian charged down the ramp, with Broll not far behind.
As Carolyn muttered a curse beside her, the two spell-casters followed, stopping halfway down the ramp. Kamery and Elthas had slipped into the shadows for the moment, but as the battle was joined, both ambushed the same Dark Iron advisor, and he fell quickly under the combined assault.
Raynn had the attention of Angerforge and two of his advisors. While Broll had drawn one of the others to one side, Varian had the attention of the other. Kamery, Elthas, and Bryna turned their attention to Varian’s opponent with wordless agreement. They all knew that Carolyn would be hard-pressed to heal three at once, and that Varian’s aggressive style was by far the hardest on the priestess.
As the Dark Iron advisor fell, Bryna glanced at Carolyn. The priestess’s face was set in familiar determination. Her spell-casting was almost non-stop. Bryna suppressed a chuckle as she imagined Carolyn’s displeasure with not being free to join the melee as she liked. Surveying the scene below, she saw that Broll’s target was flagging under the fresh assault from Kamery and Elthas. Varian had turned on Angerforge now, although some of his swings also struck the other two advisors.
Meanwhile, Raynn was easily blocking and parrying most of the blows aimed her way, while also landing enough hits to keep her enemies attention on her. One of the advisors was trying to circle around, to flank the warrior. Focusing on that Dark Iron, Bryna muttered a spell, and he gave a small squawk as he was turned into a duck.
Unfortunately, the spell didn’t last long. It was fragile, and Varian’s wild blows broke the enchantment. With a sigh, Bryna resumed her frosty assault. It wasn’t long until Broll, Kamery, and Elthas joined the main fray, and shortly afterwards, Angerforge and the remaining advisors fell.</Text>

            <Text>The sun hung low in the sky as Thrall, Jaina, and Raynn stood on the hill overlooking Northwatch Hold. The atmosphere was peaceful, a stark contrast to the battles that had recently unfolded at Mount Hyjal. Raynn, though not present at the recent skirmish, could feel the weight of the world on her shoulders.

Thrall, his orcish features softened by the fading sunlight, turned to Raynn. &quot;Though you weren't with us in the most recent battle, your strength and loyalty have never wavered. I've watched you grow into a formidable warrior.&quot;

Raynn nodded, acknowledging his words with a hint of gratitude. &quot;Thank you, Warchief. I've learned much under your leadership.&quot;

Jaina, her blue eyes reflecting the somber hues of the evening, spoke gently. &quot;Raynn, the recent events have been trying for all of us. Thrall and I have been discussing your future.&quot;

Raynn's brow furrowed in curiosity. &quot;My future, Lady Jaina?&quot;

Jaina nodded. &quot;Thrall must return to Orgrimmar, and I'll be staying here in Theramore. But we believe it would be beneficial for you to explore your roots in Stormwind.&quot;

Thrall added, &quot;You've proven your worth, Raynn. The world is vast, and there's much to discover about your people. This is an opportunity for you to forge your own path.&quot;

Raynn took a moment to absorb their words, a mix of gratitude and uncertainty in her eyes. &quot;I appreciate your guidance, both of you. But what about you, Warchief? When will our paths cross again?&quot;

Thrall's expression grew solemn. &quot;My duties are in Orgrimmar. I must lead my people. But our paths may cross again, Raynn. The future is uncertain, and the bonds we've formed will endure.&quot;

Jaina added, &quot;You're a strong and capable warrior, Raynn. I have no doubt you'll find your way.&quot;

Raynn nodded, a determined gleam in her eyes. &quot;I'll make my way to Stormwind then, Lady Jaina. And I'll carry the lessons you've both taught me.&quot;

As the sun dipped below the horizon, they stood together on the hill, the weight of parting settling in. Thrall clasped Raynn's shoulder, and Jaina offered a reassuring smile. The trio shared a final moment before their paths diverged, leaving Raynn to step into the unknown, her destiny unfolding in the world beyond.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Elthas walks through Theramore with his thoughts while the others interrogate Hendel
- Lieutenant Aden asks Elthas to investigate Sentry Point rumors</Synopsis>
            <Text>Far from the lush jungles of Stranglethorn Vale, the foreboding swamps of Dustwallow Marsh surrounded the Human outpost of Theramore. Elthas’s paws made no sound on the cobblestones as he made his way slowly along the road that circled Jaina’s tower. The dominant white stone tower stood in the center of the town. It rose high overhead, dwarfing even the large keep and the two inns that housed most of the population of the small town, in addition to travelers passing through. The buildings were the typical architecture of the Humans, composed of either solid stone or oak beams supporting white-painted walls. Blue-tiled roofs covered all of the buildings.
A ship’s bell rang in the distance, competing with the closer sound of rhythmic hammering from the nearby blacksmith. Elthas’s pace picked up to avoid the acrid scent of heated metal. He could feel the heat of the building from the road.
Behind the blacksmith stood the stables, and he slowed again, although the smell of hay tickled his nose, threatening a sneeze. He watched the placid horses thoughtfully, remembering Carolyn’s tale of her run through the Wetlands the previous year, and the sister’s more recent stories of running messages through the various territories of Stormwind. The Humans should learn to ride horses, he decided, wondering if his panther could even keep up with the creatures.
Leaving the stables behind, Elthas quickened again as he passed the large domicile of most of the locals. He and his friends had secured rooms at the other inn, on the other side of the town. The heavy stone walls that protected the perimeter of the town opened up beyond, leading to the docks and the open ocean.
He breathed deeply of the salt air, remembering that he had yet to show Carolyn his new form. A shiver of excitement rippled his dark fur as he remembered the sleek form slicing through the water around Teldrassil. Although they had just recently crossed the sea, they had been so distracted in Menethil and again here, he hadn’t thought of it. During the crossing, the ship had been moving too fast, and he would have been left behind if he had entered the water. He was determined to share his new form with the priestess soon though.
Elthas’s thoughts turned to Carolyn, as his walk continued between the tower where the priestess was now, and the citadel that housed the town’s protectors. Jaina had transported their captive to her tower, and his Human companions had joined her to question him. Elthas thought that Kamery likely had experience in such matters; Bryna’s quick mind would be sure to identify discrepancies in the man’s words, and the mage wouldn’t have wanted to be left out anyway; and Carolyn could use her Shadow magics to peer into Hendel’s mind.
Elthas frowned inwardly at that thought, his steps slowing again. He knew that the priestess disliked using the Shadow side of her vocation, preferring the beneficial magic of the Light. He understood; he felt the same way about twisting Nature magic to deal damage, in the way that the destructive sprites did.
The clatter of sword blows falling on wood and metal drew his attention to the training yards outside the citadel, and he remembered their fifth companion, the warrior Raynn. They hadn’t seen her since he had left Stormwind, and he wondered briefly what she was doing now. She had said that she was going to Ironforge. His muzzle wrinkled in distaste at the thought of the underground Dwarven city; even the acrid smoke of the Dwarven District of Stormwind had been too much for him. Raynn had seemed comfortable there, but Elthas had trouble even imagining the oppressiveness of a city built within a mountain.
The thoughts and memories were so distracting that Elthas almost missed the enticing scents coming from the inn. Roasting meats and simmering root vegetables. His mouth watered, anticipating the evening’s meal, although it was still only midday.
He had almost completed his circuit of the town now, as he passed the inn and once more approached the junction of the ring road with the road leading out into the swamp beyond. Yet another place filled with objectionable smells, although at least those were mostly natural. He frowned, hoping they could go somewhere fresher soon. He paid little heed to the soldiers standing guard at either side of the wide gates.
“Hail, druid,” a deep voice broke into his thoughts, coming from somewhere well above and just behind him. Elthas turned and looked up to see a sturdy Human in armor sitting atop a large horse. The Human was looking down at him.
Elthas was momentarily surprised at his nature being recognized so easily, but then remembered that, despite the Human surroundings, they were in Kalimdor. Although some distance from his homeland, other Kaldorei would also travel through this place. Despite his druidic masters’ attitude of patient indulgence, Elthas knew that he wasn’t the only Kaldorei, or even druid, with a penchant for adventure and exploration.
Shifting out of form, Elthas approached the Human. On horseback, the soldier was even taller than a Kaldorei, the druid noted with satisfaction, standing tall.
“I am Lieutenant Aden,” the Human introduced himself. “My duty is to guard the gates here, but I have been made aware of disturbing rumors coming from the watchtower to the north.” He gestured, and Elthas looked over his shoulder to see the top of the tower barely visible over the trees beyond the gates. He and his companions had passed the first tower on their way to apprehend Hendel, and he knew it wasn’t far.
As Elthas turned back to him, Aden continued, “There is talk of a recent shipwreck off the shore north of Theramore, and tales of possible survivors wearing red Defias bandannas. If you would be willing, could you aid in investigating these rumors?”
Elthas considered the request. The thought of the Defias having a foothold in Kalimdor alarmed him, but he didn’t want to leave his Human friends behind. He nodded, but told the man, “I have friends here also. If you see them, could you tell them where I have gone? Three Human females. A golden-haired priestess, her sister, a rogue wearing all black leather, and a mage wearing a large red hat.”
At the last description, Aden’s eyes lit up with recognition. “Ah, Lady Hawthorne. I am well acquainted with her from her studies with Lady Proudmoore.”
Elthas had never heard Bryna referred to as ‘Lady’ before, but as he doubted there would be many other mages in red hats and in the company of sisters of day-and-night, he nodded.
“I will inform them if I see them,” Aden assured the druid. The Human sat so motionless, his gaze fixed on the gate, that Elthas wondered if he would notice them if they did not pass immediately in front of him. The Human was continuing his instructions though, “Seek out Captain Wymor at Sentry Point.”
Reassured and happy to have a task to occupy his time, Elthas turned away from the town and its imposing central tower. He deliberately waited to shift to feline form until had passed the gates, so as not to startle the Lieutenant’s mount. The horse had stood placidly enough, but its hooves had looked heavy, with their steel shoes added by the Human blacksmiths—he would prefer to avoid being kicked by those.
Loping easily along the road, Elthas reveled in the freedom of being back in nature—even if that nature was damp and decaying. Death was a part of life, he knew, and the swamp had a life of its own. His ears twitched as mosquitoes swarmed him. Perhaps the swamp had too much life of its own.
The tower at Sentry Point came into sight, and he realized that he would have to shift again to talk to the Humans stationed there. Carolyn usually handled all the talking. He wondered how the interrogation of Private Hendel was progressing.</Text>

            <Text>Varian paced away, his footsteps echoing in the stillness of the Draenor night. The weight of responsibility bore down on him, a burden that transcended the physical armor he wore. The clash of ideals with Raynn lingered, each word a reminder of Stormwind's expectations.
Yet, as he distanced himself from the garrison's center, Varian found his steps halting. The cool breeze carried whispers of battle and uncertainty, mirroring the turbulence within him. He clenched his fists, grappling with conflicting emotions.
The moonlit silhouette of Raynn, framed against the Garrison walls, haunted his thoughts. Her strength, her unwavering commitment to her beliefs, stirred something within him that he hadn't anticipated. The magnetic pull of her presence lingered, prompting him to reconsider the rigid walls he'd erected around himself.
Varian turned, retracing his steps, and approached Raynn once more. The moonlight outlined her figure, accentuating the determination etched on her face. His gaze softened, catching the glint of silver in her auburn hair.
&quot;Commander,&quot; he called, his voice less authoritative, revealing a vulnerability he rarely allowed to surface.
Raynn turned, her amber eyes meeting his with a mixture of curiosity and reservation. &quot;Your Majesty?&quot;
Varian paused, the moon casting shadows across his stern visage. &quot;This war has cost us much, and the road ahead is uncertain. We may not always agree on the path, but I can't deny your strength and dedication.&quot;
Raynn's guarded expression softened slightly, a trace of surprise in her eyes.
Varian took a step closer, his voice low, almost a whisper carried away by the wind. &quot;Strength deserves acknowledgment, even when veiled in disagreement.&quot;
A flicker of understanding passed between them, a recognition that extended beyond the complexities of politics and war. Varian's gaze lingered on Raynn, not just as a commander but as a woman of resilience and conviction.
Raynn, though uncertain of Varian's intentions, sensed a shift in the air. The moonlight played on the edges of her armor, casting a subdued glow. &quot;Your Majesty, we all carry the weight of our choices in this war. Unity, even among differences, is our greatest strength.&quot;
Varian nodded, acknowledging the truth in her words. As he turned to leave once more, his steps were less rigid, and the turmoil within him seemed to ease, if only momentarily. The night embraced Lunarfall, shrouding the Garrison in a tranquil stillness—a temporary respite before the storm of challenges that awaited them on Draenor's unforgiving soil.</Text>

            <Title>Moonbrook</Title>
            <Text>“They’re in there.” Loran’s voice was tight with trepidation as he and Kamery crouched in the shadows beside the inn in Moonbrook. His hand indicated a large barn across the way. Keeping his voice low, he explained. “They have mines below. I’ve never been down there though.”
Kamery nodded, her eyes taking in the ramshackle building. It was a good cover for an underground operation. She drew Loran back quietly, as two men in red bandannas emerged from the building. They were chatting amiably, relaxed in the knowledge of the Defias’s hold over this town. Her hand on Loran’s shoulder felt the boy’s tension.
“Stay still,” she advised, her words barely a breath. The two watched until the Defias thugs had passed out of sight along the main road. Kamery took the lead now, heading behind the inn to the edge of the town. Finding a run-down abandoned shed, she settled Loran in the shadows. The boy had good instincts, but he would need practice to pass as unseen as she could.
Her steps light, Kamery blended into the shadows and, with silent grace, entered the wide entrance to the barn. The musty smell of hay hit her nostrils, and she fought against a sneeze. Taking a breath, she took a moment at the edge of the wide room, allowing her eyes to adjust to the darkness. The lower floor of the barn was empty save for a few small piles of hay. A rickety staircase hinted at a second floor. Curious, Kamery crept that way. Loran had indicated that the base was underground.
The staircase led to a small side room, to one side of the main barn building, rather than part of it. Within that room, Kamery found what she had been looking for—a staircase spiraled down, leading into the earth below the building. With a series of agile moves, she dropped quickly down the two stories, and found herself in a tunnel that sloped down in a wide curve.
Hugging the walls, she made her way down the rough passageway. She could hear the faint clang of metal on rock from below. As she proceeded, the sound was joined by a murmur of voices. Then, another voice, this one closer. A second voice responded. Two people were approaching up the tunnel. Finding a narrow crevice, Kamery pressed back against the wall. She kept her breathing slow and even. Her heart pounded, but she kept her attention on the two men walking past her.
Their conversation was the casual banter between friends. They were heading up to the town for a night at the inn. One had high hopes for the red-haired barmaid. Kamery’s eyes narrowed. She hoped that the girl was experienced enough to handle these thugs. As they passed out of earshot, a word caught her attention. They were talking about a ship.
Her curiosity piqued, Kamery pressed on. The bustle of activity below was intense. She knew that if she was caught, she wouldn’t stand a chance. The Defias operation was already unfolding to be far more than any of them had suspected. Wiley had hinted at it; perhaps she should have given his trepidation more weight.
Peering around a corner, Kamery saw a hive of activity. Humans, gnolls, and Goblins were scurrying about, mining out a huge area. Beyond them, a maze of tunnels led even further into the earth under Westfall’s southern hills. One particularly large one was barred with a massive steel door. Shaking her head, Kamery decided that she had seen enough. She wouldn’t get any further alone and Stoutmantle needed to hear about the extent of the Defias operation.
Silently, Kamery turned and retraced her steps back to the surface. Luckily, she had no further encounters along the way, and shortly returned to the waiting Loran. The boy had fallen asleep. When she woke him, he looked startled. She wondered if it was from being woken, or if he was surprised that she had survived.
Motioning Loran to follow and stay quiet, she led the way behind the inn. They would have to circle wide around the small town to return to Sentinel Hill, but it would be better than passing through the Defias-infested streets again.
As they passed through the dark, starlit fields, both were silent. Kamery’s thoughts replayed the sights below Moonbrook, committing the details to memory. They reached Sentinel Hill uneventfully, and true to his word, Stoutmantle delivered Loran to Heather Lowry, who set the boy up on a cot in a corner of her kitchen.
Back outside the inn, Stoutmantle listened to Kamery’s report, his face growing grave. “This is beyond my capabilities,” he admitted. “My men are too few, and I don’t dare start an outright war with the forces you describe.” Kamery’s heart sank, but she knew that his assessment was sound.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Kamery and Elthas fight a gnoll
- Elthas goes bear, then heals; Kamery is impressed
- Kamery picks the lock on the steel door</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Kamery and Elthas scouted the smaller tunnels, the rogue watched her companion curiously. She hadn’t thought of druids as stealthy before, but the powerful cat prowling beside her seemed so natural. Until now, her only exposure to druids had been the few who spent most of their time in the park in Stormwind. They never used their animal forms, and were known for their healing and herbal knowledge. She had sought out advice from several of them as she had developed her alchemical skills.
The narrow tunnels proved mostly empty, with only a few cowering kobolds, and Kamery began to relax. A snarl to one side of the final tunnel chastised her inattention, as a gnoll straggler spotted the pair. Kamery raised her daggers defensively, parrying his initial attack. The large creature gave her no opportunity to attack though. It pressed her back, her boots scuffling along the dusty tunnel floor. Focused on Kamery, the gnoll barely noticed Elthas clawing at its flank.
A guttural, distinctly non-feline growl surprised Kamery. Behind the gnoll was no longer a sleek black panther, but a massive bear, swiping at the gnoll with its vicious claws. That drew the gnoll’s attention, and it turned to face the now-greater threat. Grateful for the reprieve, Kamery went on the offensive. Swift strikes at vulnerable points quickly dispatched their foe. As it hit the ground with a thud, Kamery looked over the body to meet Elthas’s eyes.
She didn’t have time to study the bear closely though, as he quickly shifted out of form, stooping slightly in the low tunnel. “You’re hurt,” he observed, his brow furrowing, and she became aware of the throbbing ache in her left arm. Motes of green light swirled around Elthas’s hands, reminding her of the trees of Elwynn Forest. Kamery watched, fascinated, as he gestured and the healing energy swept over her, bringing rejuvenating warmth to her arm.
“Talented,” she breathed, her eyes wide.
The tall Kaldorei grinned as he shifted back into feline form, the expression remaining on the panther’s muzzle as he bounded back up the now-clear tunnel to rejoin their companions.
Kamery followed more slowly, her mind absorbing what had just happened. There was so much more to the druid than she had realized. He had shifted so smoothly between forms and roles; she wondered how much more he was capable of.
Arriving back at the steel door, she found that the others had used their time waiting to examine it.
“It’s locked,” Raynn told the returned scouts. One mail-clad hand pointed out parts of the mechanism. “It looks like it hinges here, on counterweights. But the bolt here, it won’t open. There’s a keyhole there.”
Kamery moved closer, reaching into her pouch for her lock-picks. Slipping the tool into the indicated keyhole, she probed gently, cautious of tripwires. When her first examination found nothing suspicious, she felt about for the locking mechanism. It turned out to be a simple tumbler, and a few deft moves later, she heard it click open.</Text>

            <Title>Southshore - Thrall2</Title>
            <Text>Thrall, Warchief of the Horde, watched the scene unfold from his vantage point, the revelations from Farsight lingering in his mind. The orcish warriors loading onto ships, the human army marching towards an inevitable confrontation, and the lone figure of Raynn caught in the middle—all were pieces of a puzzle that demanded resolution.
As the last of the humans disappeared into the distance, Thrall and Grom rode towards Raynn, their war wolves carrying them with purpose. Grom's voice, gruff and determined, echoed the weight of a blood oath. Thrall nodded in agreement, his mind contemplating the complexities that unfolded.
Grom's words, &quot;You come with us, human,&quot; were delivered with an unmistakable sense of urgency, a blood oath rekindled by the threat looming over the girl. Thrall understood the honor that bound Grom to this promise, and the responsibility he, too, felt as Warchief.
The slight hesitation in Raynn's response didn't escape Thrall's observant gaze. Grom's explanation, spoken with a sternness that conveyed both duty and concern, weighed heavily on her. Thrall recognized the acceptance in her eyes—the realization that she stood at the crossroads of alliances, and her fate would no longer be tethered to the Wildhammers.
&quot;I'll go with you,&quot; she declared, her voice steady and determined.
Thrall felt a mixture of relief and uncertainty. Relief that Grom's honor-bound promise would be upheld, and uncertainty about the unknown path they were embarking upon. The girl's actions spoke of a bravery that transcended the racial tensions of their world.
As she scribbled a note to the Wildhammers, Thrall sensed the unspoken complexities of her decision—the sacrifice she made for the promise of protection. Together, they rode back to Southshore, the ships standing tall as silent vessels of destiny. Thrall boarded his flagship, his mind grappling with the weight of leadership and the uncharted waters that awaited them. The Horde set sail, guided by the winds of fate and the unspoken bond that now tied them to the journey ahead.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Kamery follows Elthas out of the Stockades</Synopsis>
            <Text>Prologue
The contrast from the windswept, snow-covered mountains of Dun Morogh was incredible.
Four years ago, she had emerged from a magical portal into Stormwind—a bustling, sprawling city unlike anything she had experienced before. White stone building had towered all around, as far as she could see, standing free and proud, a sharp contrast to the mountainside homes of the Dwarves, or the rough tents and cabins of her childhood.
Alone and intimidated, she hadn’t stayed long—only as long as it took her to learn about the gryphon-masters and the easy flight to Ironforge. A year ago, the Great Flood of Ironforge had prompted her return south. Still, despite being her father’s homeland, Stormwind’s grandeur occasionally overwhelmed her.
…
Raynn gave a genuine smile, her enthusiasm for the question apparent. With a swift motion, she reached up to her brow and removed something. The moment the light circlet came free, it shimmered into visibility, revealing the layers of magic woven into the golden band. Kamery’s eyes widened at the sight as Raynn held it up. “Enchanted, for protection and invisibility.” Her voice was filled with a mixture of pride and appreciation. Kamery admired the craftsmanship, while simultaneously cataloging the intricate details for future research.
“Where did you get it?” Kamery kept her voice light. “We get visitors from all over, but I can’t quite place your accent.” As soon as she finished, Kamery knew that she had gone too far, too quickly. The tension in Raynn’s body was subtle, but unmistakable.
“From a friend.” Her answer was terse, with an undercurrent of guardedness and, Kamery thought, pain. With a practiced motion, Raynn set the circlet back on her brow, removing it from sight once more. Honest, but not even close to the full picture, Kamery knew. 
3: Some Assembly Required
Flying overhead on a hired gryphon, Raynn reveled in the familiar feeling of the wind on her face, blowing her ponytail out behind her. She didn’t ride much these days—the gryphon masters of Stormwind had trained their charges well—they would only fly where their master directed them.
Although her first such flight had returned her to the comfort of Ironforge four years ago, she had chafed at the restriction. She missed having control over the mount herself, as she had in her youth in Aerie Peak.
The Wildhammer Dwarves had taken her in as a young foster, when she’d had nowhere else to go, not long after her life had been completely shattered. She had enjoyed her time with them, but the three happy years of learning combat techniques, blacksmithing, and gryphon riding had ended abruptly. That, Raynn knew, she had brought on herself, but—despite upending her life again—she had no regrets for her actions that fateful day in Southshore.
As the well-trained gryphon circled in to land at its familiar perch, the approaching ground  pushed away her turbulent memories of her lost mentor, bringing her thoughts back to the current moment.
6: It’s Not Over Yet
As she walked along the canal towards the Dwarven District, Raynn’s mind lingered on the past few days. They had come together well in a short time, fighting as one cohesive group. Raynn’s heart swelled at the memories, despite her now-conflicted thoughts about VanCleef and the Defias. They had gone too far, that was certain. But at the same time, she understood hopelessness and fighting against injustice with desperation. Memories of Thrall flooded her mind, of the Orcish Warchief’s quest to liberate his people.
Thrall had fought with honor though, Raynn reminded herself, remembering the Defias dreadnought filled with explosives that she and her companions had destroyed. And the Warchief had fought only when he had no other option. He had offered the internment camps a choice; it was the Humans who had refused him and forced his hand. Who had—no, she couldn’t think about her parents now. Cold anger ran through her as she crossed the final bridge. She needed the blacksmithing hammer more than ever now, to pour her feelings into the metal instead.
The atmosphere of the Dwarven District was instantly soothing, reminding her of the happier times that had followed all of the turmoil.
8: SI:7
She shouldn’t be afraid. She was proud of her upbringing, as unconventional as it may have been.
But explaining it…she would have to admit her actions in Southshore. To explain that, she would have to explain what Grom and Thrall had meant to her. She closed her eyes briefly, swallowing hard against the myriad of emotions that thoughts of Grom always brought. Explaining would mean delving into the twisting, intertwining threads of herself, Grom, Thrall, and her parents. And that day, she did not want to relive, even in her own mind, let alone out loud.
As her thoughts drifted too close to painful memories, Raynn pushed the past back to the darkest reaches of her mind.
…
Shaw interrupted her, “I know. You’re not a threat. But I admit, your unconventional style drew my curiosity.” He paused, as if deciding what to say next. Raynn waited silently, now curious herself. “Your accent…Lordaeron born?”
Raynn nodded tightly.
“And you’ve spent time with the Dwarves,” Shaw added, studying her.
This, she could answer fairly truthfully, so she offered him that, hoping it would be enough. “I’m studying with the blacksmiths in Ironforge.”
Shaw nodded, accepting that for now. His eyes told her that he knew it went deeper, but he didn’t probe.
12: Final Reports
The sound of Raynn’s boots rang out on the polished marble of the Stormwind keep floors. The gleaming white stone city was imposing; the keep was even more so. It had unsettled her so much on her first arrival four years ago that she hadn’t stayed long.
She had come to learn about the city’s history and its people, on the advice of the two people who had mattered most to her. However, overwhelmed by the unfamiliarity, she had almost immediately escaped on the easy flight north to Ironforge; she knew the Dwarven city had an extensive and well-maintained library, and her father had always spoken almost reverently about the smiths there.
Even since returning to Stormwind a year ago, she found solace both in the smoky comfort of the Dwarven district in Stormwind and in the convenient escape provided by the new Deeprun Tram, connecting the two cities with Gnomish ingenuity.
15: On the Road
Having grown up amongst the close-minded people of Lordaeron, she had been pleased to find that the Humans of Stormwind, her father’s people, were more open-minded. However, her father had also worked closely with the Dwarves in Khaz Modan. Later, living among them herself—in Dun Modr, then Aerie Peak, and finally Ironforge itself—she had become accustomed to their gruff ways and the heavy stone buildings that so many other Humans found oppressive. Although she didn’t live there permanently anymore, she loved Ironforge, and felt a sense of homecoming as the Tram rattled into the station.
…
The Dwarves had been proud allies during the war, until their lands had been overrun by the Orcish Horde. Raynn was proud that her father had been among those to help liberate this bustling city, only weeks after she had been born. Throughout her early life, he had done well to spend time with his young family, while still aiding the Dwarves in fully taking back their lands.
Her heart tightened as she remembered the smiling man who had first introduced her to the forge, when she had only been six years old, against her mother’s laughing protests. She hoped that he would have been proud of how far she had come, of what she had accomplished. She was here today for the culmination of that work, not to reminisce; those happy early days had been over too soon. Resolutely, Raynn pushed the bittersweet memories away and focused on the present.
17: The Mithril Order
The small port town was a haven of ruffians and pirates, but rough-looking Goblin bruisers, working for the Steamwheedle Cartel, kept the peace in the town. Years ago, Raynn had encountered similar guards, in the Cartel town of Ratchet, in Kalimdor. Although not much more than half her height, the green-skinned Goblins were tough and muscular, and could easily subdue even a massive Tauren.
22: Mastery of Mithril
“She's a cruel mistress, is she not, Raynn?” The Dwarf pulled out a nugget of glossy, liquid-like silvery metal. “I'm speaking of truesilver, naturally. Aye, Galvan spent over a decade in the mountains of Alterac learning this lesson.” The mention of Alterac made Raynn’s heart clench briefly with memory, but she pushed it aside, focusing on the instruction.
…
Succumbing to exhaustion, Raynn fell into a deep sleep right after finishing her meal. When she woke to the morning sunlight filtering through the trees, she was thankful that the sleep was deep enough to stave off nightmares. Her memories occasionally welled up in her sleep, when she wasn’t aware enough to push them away. Although infrequent, those nights always left her exhausted and unsettled. She would need her focus for the upcoming work.
25: Decisions
Sitting on the edge of her narrow bed in the Booty Bay Inn, Raynn stared at the large map mounted on the wooden wall opposite her. Built from a half-grounded ship, the inn creaked and swayed with the movement of the ocean outside. The salty tang of sea air pervaded the cramped room, tucked in the bow of the vessel. The narrow space made the map easily viewable, and Raynn’s eyes wandered over the familiar reaches of Kalimdor.
The routes of the ships from Booty Bay were traced out in red, overlaying the standard map of Azeroth. The direct route, of course, would be the southern route—to Steamwheedle Port, on the eastern coastline of Tanaris, and then just a short trip along a well-traveled road through the desert to Gadgetzan.
Her eyes kept returning to the northern line though, as it traced the route to Ratchet, in the Barrens. She knew from experience that it was just a short trip down the coast from the Goblin town to Theramore. To Jaina Proudmoore. Her fingers twisted in the worn fabric of her bedding as her heart ached at the memory.
Raynn stood between Jaina and Thrall as the three looked down on the now-deserted Northwatch Hold. Admiral Proudmoore, Jaina’s father, had recently waged war on the Horde from that fortress, and others along the coast, including usurping Jaina’s own neutral town of Theramore.
Raynn, along with the other inhabitants, had huddled on the upper floor of the inn, watching through the windows as the Horde entered the town and their leader, Rexxar, had entered Jaina’s tower, which hadn’t been Jaina’s at that time.
The Orcs had outmatched Proudmoore’s forces, and Jaina had ordered Theramore’s own guards to stand down. There was an uneasy truce in most parts of the town, with the exception of the tower. Eventually, Rexxar had emerged, victorious, and led his warriors away.
Jaina had emerged, and told them Theramore was safe once again; that they were once more at peace with the Horde. Relieved, the townspeople had resumed their lives.
But the incident had changed Jaina’s attitude towards Raynn. Now, she and Thrall were telling Raynn that she should travel to Stormwind, and find her heritage, among her father’s people.
Thrall laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. “There is value in knowing one’s past. Do not let your perceptions always be colored that day. Our paths will cross again; the bonds we’ve forged will endure.” His look included all three of them.
Jaina held out a circlet, intricately wrought of gold. With a smile, she explained, “I know you hate wearing a helmet in practice. Someday, you will find a real battle. This is enchanted; it will protect you as well as any helm.”
At Raynn’s doubtful look at the glinting metal, she added, “It will also be invisible when you wear it. But only then—” her eyes sparkled teasingly “—you wouldn’t want to forget where you left it now, would you?”
Glancing over at the circlet, now laying on the small table beside her bed, Raynn smiled at the memory, her eyes glistening. Jaina had always been perceptive and thoughtful.
She had been resentful then, feeling rejected by the two people she admired and trusted the most. Looking back now, she could admit that they had been right.
After Admiral Proudmoore’s death, Jaina had been cut off from her homeland entirely. She had been in command of a far-flung, unsupported outpost, with only the most tenuous of peace agreements with the Horde. Proudmoore had shown that it was only too easy for the old tensions to flare up again.
Thrall had likewise faced the same situation. Raynn had longed to join him in Orgrimmar, but there were too many in the Horde who held lingering resentment, or even hatred, towards Humans. She wouldn’t have been safe there, and she knew he had felt an obligation to protect her still.
No, it had been for her own safety, and her own growth, that they had sent her away. And she had taken their advice; both had suggested she learn about her father’s people, about the Humans of Stormwind, not Lordaeron, and she had. First, from the more comfortable libraries of the Dwarves, but then later in the libraries of Stormwind itself.
She had met good people in Stormwind too, she realized. Carolyn, the priestess with the warm smile and the penchant for melee. Elthas, the exuberant feline druid. Bryna, the quick-minded mage. Even Kamery, the too-curious rogue.
With a fond smile, Raynn made her decision. She would take the longer route, and she would go thank Jaina.
26: Destination: Theramore
Theramore’s main gate came into view shortly, and Raynn felt a brief moment of panic, but she pushed it away. She knew why Jaina had sent her away; knew that it hadn’t been personal. And now, she was more than capable of protecting herself.
Passing into the familiar town, she wondered if much had changed in four years. The tower was still there, a solid, comforting presence in the center of town. The travelers’ inn stood to the left of the entrance, warm light spilling from its windows. She would stay there tonight, rather than the other inn that she had lived in before, which was for townspeople only.
But beside that other inn stood the stables, so, passing the blacksmith’s with a glance, Raynn brought her horse to the open-fronted structure for a rest. Scuffing the remains of the mud off her boots in the straw, she walked back past the blacksmith’s again. Emotions tumbled within her as she regarded the building, and she couldn’t quite identify how she felt.
At first, she had been recovering from injury, and the healers had forbidden her from any physical activity. Even when she had recovered though, the town’s blacksmith had absolutely refused to apprentice her; Marie had said that she was too young, but she had been a year older than the boy the woman took on a few weeks later. Raynn had been angry at the time, knowing that she already knew more about the trade than the lad.
When she had been allowed to begin training again, she had poured all of her rage into the target dummies by the citadel on the other side of town. The soldiers there had been appalled at the wild strikes that she had learned from Grom Hellscream, calling it a loss of control, even though every movement had been precise and balanced.
She felt a twinge of sadness at the memory of Grom. Bound by a blood oath to protect her, he had fought fiercely against the bloodlust in her presence. Pressing a hand to the scar on her side, she wondered what might have happened to her if she hadn’t been injured and sent away with Jaina.
Theramore’s soldiers, at least, had taken her in and taught her, she realized, with one last glance at the smithy. And the Dwarves had taught her more about blacksmithing than she ever would have learned here; she was certain that her skill surpassed Marie’s now. She had learned to move past old resentments too, and she turned her attention to the path leading into the tower.
…
But before Bryna could say anything, Jaina gave a happy exclamation. “Raynn!” The arch-mage rose and swiftly crossed to the warrior, drawing her into an embrace. To Bryna’s surprise, the usually stiff warrior didn’t recoil, but instead returned the embrace warmly.
“Jaina,” Raynn was smiling easily. “It’s good to see you again.” She noticed Bryna then, and her amber eyes widened in surprise. “Bryna?”
…
She hadn’t hesitated to name the target of their less-than-legal intervention in Stormwind, Bryna noted. Raynn seemed to trust Jaina implicitly.
“How do you two know each other?” Bryna asked instead.
“Raynn stayed here for a while when she was younger,” Jaina told Bryna, which just opened up more questions, but the arch-mage moved on to answer Raynn’s query. “Bryna came here to study.” She indicated the bookshelves lining the walls of the office. “Her friends showed up not long after, investigating…” She sighed wistfully before continuing. “I had arranged for Varian Wrynn and Thrall to meet, to discuss a more lasting peace.”
Raynn’s eyes widened, reflecting surprise and an unmistakable surge of excited hope that caught Bryna off guard.
Jaina continued though, “Varian’s ship disappeared en route to Theramore.” Raynn’s shoulders slumped in disappointment, but her face was thoughtful as she listened to the rest of the story.
…
Raynn shot an apologetic glance at Jaina. “I spent the first three years in Ironforge,” she admitted suddenly, confusing Bryna again.
Jaina smiled understandingly though. “You did return to Stormwind though, it seems?”
Raynn nodded. “The Dwarves have a good library,” she added defensively. “I learned a lot there too. About Stormwind and…the liberation of Khaz Modan.”
Bryna tried to follow the conversation, but there was a lot being left unsaid, and she realized that she was watching the reunion of two close friends.
Surprising, as she hadn’t realized Raynn allowed anyone close to her. She wondered briefly if Shaw knew about this connection, but immediately dismissed the thought. Shaw’s curiosity didn’t matter, on the matter of Raynn’s background, at least.
Jaina broke the moment of quiet understanding between herself and Raynn suddenly, reaching up to touch the warrior’s temple lightly. Feeling something there, she gave a delighted smile. “You still have it?!”
Raynn’s face broke into another genuine smile as she nodded. “Of course!” She reached up, and to Bryna’s surprise and fascination, she pulled off a magical circlet, the gold band shimmering into existence as it came free.
Jaina looked at the object for a moment, then held out her hand. “Let me see if I can improve on my old work.”
29: The Caverns of Time
“This—” he gestured to a time-way winding into vaguely familiar rolling hills “—is the time-way to Hillsbrad of the past—seven years to be exact.” Of course, Bryna realized, the terrain reminded her of the area surrounding Dalaran’s crater. Carolyn and Kamery looked mildly interested; Elthas seemed a bit confused, but accepting. Raynn, however, had been tense since they had approached the miniature landscape, and now she appeared deep in thought.
Andormu continued, “Forces are working against the Horde Warchief, Thrall, attempting to prevent him from ever escaping Durnholde Keep.”
Raynn drew in a sharp breath at that, and even Elthas stopped his pacing. Bryna’s mind turned over the implications. The Horde had been a destructive force, but hadn’t most of that been in the early days of the Wars? There had been skirmishes between Alliance and Horde for as long as she could remember, but Jaina had thought that Varian and Thrall could forge a lasting peace, until the King had disappeared.
“If Thrall never escapes, this world—as you know it—will cease to exist.” Andormu’s warning was ominous, but vague. Bryna racked her memory for why, but it seemed that at least two of her companions knew that answer. Raynn and Elthas were both nodding their heartfelt agreements with the statement. A glance at Kamery and Carolyn told Bryna that the twin sisters were just as mystified as she was.
Raynn had already started forward though, as Andormu directed them into the time-way, telling them to find the bronze dragon agents already inside. Bryna followed, bracing herself against the disorientation that came with time travel, and the five emerged into a shallow cave overlooking the Hillsbrad Foothills.
30: Escape from Durnholde
They were here for a mission though, the druid reminded himself, returning his attention to the others in the cave. He could see that the Humans from Stormwind were confused, and wondered how much they knew of the history of Kalimdor. Of all of Azeroth, really, he realized.
Raynn had seemed more familiar, reminding Elthas of his first impressions of the warrior and how she had reminded him of Kalimdor. It had been at Mount Hyjal, in Kalimdor, that Thrall, and the Horde, had been instrumental in defeating Archimonde and turning back the invasion of the Burning Legion.
“Greetings,” a bronze dragon greeted them. “I am Erozion. Here, the Infinite flight has kidnapped Taretha Foxton, daughter of the secretary of Aedelas Blackmoore, ruler of Durnholde and overseer of all internment camps on Azeroth.”
At Erozion’s mention of Blackmoore’s name, Raynn’s hands tightened into fists. This was personal for her, Elthas realized.
“It was Taretha who created the original diversion at Durnholde, allowing Thrall to escape,” Erozion continued. “Now the Infinite have captured Taretha. The diversion will not happen without your involvement. You must use these incendiary devices to burn down the internment lodges.”
Raynn took the proffered sack as soon as it was offered. Her step was firm and determined as she led the way out of the cave.
Watching Raynn lead the way through the foothills with easy confidence, Bryna realized, She knows where she is going. She’s lived here.
‘She lived here a few years ago,’ Jaina had said in Theramore. A few years ago? The Orcish liberation, the voyage to Kalimdor, this was only a few years ago.
“You traveled to Kalimdor with Jaina?” Bryna asked.
She startled them all, of course. Raynn seemed to be considering the question carefully.
“No,” she eventually answered.
“But then, how—“
Kamery interrupted Bryna’s next question with a sharp gesture. “It doesn’t matter,” the rogue said. “She’s here now.”
The two had reached some sort of agreement, Bryna realized. But her mind kept working. There had only been two groups that had traveled to Kalimdor at that time. The regular ships back and forth hadn’t come until much later.
With Raynn’s guidance through the unfamiliar landscape, the small group reached the solid stone walls of Durnholde Keep in no time. The warrior had led them in a circuitous path that had skirted a small town, and kept them out of sight of several watchtowers. She knew this territory well, Kamery realized, and in this time period also, not in its present-day Scourge-ravaged and Forsaken-occupied state.
…
“They want a distraction. We’ll give them one.” The warrior’s voice was tight and hard, but controlled.
…
Not suicidal, no, but she efficiently cut a path through the defenses of the keep with a cold ruthlessness that matched even the most hardened assassins of SI:7.
She didn’t touch the Orc prisoners though, Kamery noticed. The Orcs, deep in their lethargy, paid the group little heed, only shuffling quietly out of the way if they were too close to a melee. Their apathy made Kamery’s heart ache; she had heard about the strange malaise, of course, but seeing it firsthand was completely different.
The Orcs watched listlessly as Raynn entered the first hut with her satchel of incendiary charges. The others waited at the door, watching for approaching guards. A handful of Orcs stood around the stove at the end of the meager room. As she set the first charge, Kamery saw Raynn say something to the Orcs. They looked at her curiously, but, the rogue realized, not in confusion; they understood her words.
As Raynn turned back to rejoin the group at the front entrance, the Orcs shuffled slowly out of the smaller door at the back of the hut.
“Won’t they interfere?” Bryna asked.
“No.” Raynn’s answer was soft, her voice and face sad. She feels more for the Orcs than the Humans here.
Four more charges, and they were done. Triggering the charges, Raynn watched in grim satisfaction as the crude huts exploded. The Orcs here would join Thrall in his search for the free clans, and would eventually return to help him liberate the rest of his people.
For now though, it was Thrall himself who needed liberating. He hadn’t spoken much of his escape, she realized, as she led the way up to the main keep. Many of the guards had been drawn out to fight the fires below, and those who remained were no match for her determination as she cleared a path to the basement.
The crude cell made her heart break, and a quick glance at her companions showed that they were likewise affected. She was relieved that they had abandoned their earlier doubts.
Keeping a stand of fir trees between themselves and the nearby watchtower, Raynn led the group across a small field.
“What if we didn’t do this?” Carolyn had mused. “The Horde has done so much damage.”
“Varian wouldn’t have been traveling to Kalimdor to get kidnapped,” Kamery had added, but her tone showed that she knew that wasn’t the only concern.
Raynn was about to speak, to give in to the emotions that this situation was rubbing raw, but it was Elthas who answered first.
“No,” the druid stated firmly. “The Horde were instrumental in the defense of the World Tree.”
Raynn had looked at the druid in surprise. She had forgotten how long-lived the Kaldorei were. “Were you there?” Had he also met Thrall and Jaina?
But Elthas shook his head. “No, I was too young. I heard it from the elder druids though. The Alliance and the Horde both, held back the demons long enough for us to summon the Wisps. No matter what they’ve done since, we can’t forget that.”
“Who are you?” Thrall’s deep voice broke her from the memory. He didn’t recognize her, Raynn realized with a pang of sadness. But of course, they wouldn’t actually meet for another year. “Just leave me be.” He sounded hopeless, not yet the Thrall she had known.
…
There were few guards remaining to stop them as they made their way across the bailey and back out of the main gates. The ones that tried were quickly dispatched by Raynn and Thrall. They fought well together, Carolyn noticed, their movements complementing each other as they stood shoulder to shoulder.
The warrior had been true to her word, and had progressed carefully through the entire incident, but Carolyn could still feel her roiling emotions. Towards the Orcs, Raynn had been sympathetic and kind, but she had dispatched the Humans opposing them with a bitter anger that chilled Carolyn.
Reaching the roadway outside the Keep, Kamery turned to Thrall. For all that Raynn had easily led them and spoken to the other Orcs in the camp, the warrior had seemed a bit at a loss with Thrall himself.
…
She hadn’t even noticed Raynn leave during the conversation, but now the warrior returned, leading a horse from the Keep’s stables. She handed the reins to Thrall, saying, “It’s no wolf, but it will have to do.”
Even Thrall seemed confused by the statement, but he mounted the horse awkwardly and spurred it down the road after Raynn.
…
She swung her sword again, feeling Thrall to her left doing the same.
Fighting next to him, the old habits came back, and she easily melded her moves with his, their swords swinging in an easy rhythm. Behind the dragon, Elthas and Kamery worked on its flanks. She knew that they had found a similar partnership in previous fights with closer quarters. Thrall, she suspected, would never attack a foe from behind. He, like her, preferred to face his enemies head-on.
…
“I have erased their memories of this event,” the bronze dragon explained. “They will continue to remember things as they should have occurred.”
Raynn’s heart sank, even as she understood the reasoning. It did explain why Thrall hadn’t seemed to know her when they did eventually meet, she realized, as Erozion returned them to their own time.
…
Raynn shook her head, setting her ponytail swaying. Elthas pulled his attention away from the hypnotic sight to listen to the warrior’s answer. “They wouldn’t have let us in anyway.” Her voice was still distant, but the tightness had lifted. The warrior had a lot of anger and pain in her past, he realized. Perhaps, he hoped, looking around the reunited group, her friends would be able to help her heal.</Text>

            <Title>ChatGPT Prompt</Title>
            <Text>Context for this session: I have written and am now revising a novel based in the Classic World of Warcraft universe, following typical player experiences. In subsequent messages, I will be providing parts of the story and asking for feedback on my writing. My writing style is closer to Kevin Hearne than J.R.R. Tolkien. Keep in mind that this is just one chapter or scene in a longer novel. Only give advice that is relevant and applicable to the text—do not offer generalized advice or best practices. Do not offer suggestions or rewrites.

Notes to keep in mind:
- I do not like overly flowery language, and especially not portentous foreshadowing.
- I write from limited third-person perspective (from the five main characters only), and usually try to avoid rapid-fire changes in perspective, so each scene will only show one character's thoughts and feelings, along with their observations of other characters.
- Do not give general advice; only mention things that are applicable to the current passage.
- Do not offer rewrites of content. I want to do the revisions myself but would appreciate guidance on areas that could be improved. Only provide specific pointers or highlight sentences that might need attention.


The story so far has introduced five main characters: Raynn, a blunt female Human warrior with a troubled past; Kamery, a pragmatic and curious female Human rogue who works for SI:7; Carolyn, a kind and determined female Human priestess and Kamery's twin sister; Elthas, an enthusiastic and optimistic male Kaldorei druid; Bryna, a pragmatic and mercenary female Human mage who has a quick mind and often gets restless.


- Looking for feedback on the writing, and the consistency of NPC characterization with known WoW lore (Classic era). Keep in mind, Varian at this time is two separate and distinct people.

- please analyze sentence fluency and pacing. If there are any specific areas that could use improvement, please point them out (but do not offer suggestions, I would like to do the rewriting myself); do not offer generalized advice.

- As an editor, please review the following novel excerpt for both strengths and areas for improvement. On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate it? Be candid and objective in your feedback.

- Please give feedback on this excerpt for clarity, descriptiveness, characterization, pacing, transitions, and sentence structure. Only give advice that is relevant and applicable to this text—do not offer generalized advice or best practices. Do not offer suggestions or rewrites.</Text>

            <Text>While Carolyn and Varian had spoken, Kamery had found Marshal Windsor’s notes. Tucking them securely in her pack, she headed up the ramp with the others. As they passed back between the bunks and tables filling the room and approached the opposite ramp, Elthas emerged from the shadows ahead of them. Kamery blinked in surprise; she hadn’t noticed the younger druid leave.
“It seems to be some sort of assembly plant for iron golems,” Elthas reported, shifting to Kaldorei form. He stood in the middle of the ramp, effectively halting their progress. Carolyn and the druid exchanged a meaningful look, and Kamery realized how attuned they had become to each other.
Elthas continued, “The workers are mainly Gnomes, but at the far end, there is a Dark Iron Dwarf. I believe he is the Golem Lord Argelmach who we seek. He is guarded by two large golems.”
With a glance at the others, Raynn started past Elthas. “Wait here, I’ll see if I can draw them up here, in smaller groups.”
Kamery slipped back into the shadows, seeing Elthas shift to feline form and do the same. She watched Varian cautiously, but he seemed to have his battle lust under control for the moment. His hands were tight on his dual swords, but he stayed with them.
As the room emptied, one small group at a time, Kamery admired Raynn’s skill at picking her targets and drawing them up the ramp with their attention fully on her. The Gnomish engineers and their constructs barely seemed to notice the others, even as they were felled one after another.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Varian and Broll are there to find Windsor
- Introductions all around</Synopsis>
            <Text>“If we may,” Kamery broke in, keeping her voice steady and respectful. “What brings you out here?” She had only heard fragments of gossip during her previous visits to Stormwind, but she had gotten the impression that the King had been markedly self-centered and frivolous since his return, more concerned with spending his people’s money on elaborate parties than with caring for affairs of state.
King Varian barely seemed to hear the question; he was still studying Carolyn with bewilderment. Ignoring what she had learned was a typical reaction to her multi-faceted sister, Kamery took the moment to study him more closely in turn. She dredged up the memories of the glimpses that she had had of the King during her training at the SI:7 headquarters in Stormwind.
His face was unmistakable, although the scars were new, but his armor looked closer to something she would expect on an Orc, with the single spike-covered pauldron and bared arms, than the full plate favored by Stormwind’s soldiers and King.
“We are seeking Marshal Reginald Windsor,” the King’s companion told them, breaking into her analysis. “I am Broll Bearmantle.”
The Kaldorei was tall among the Humans, taller even than Elthas, Kamery thought. Briefly recalling a conversation in Un’goro Crater, the rogue realized that his branching antlers were a sign of powerful druidic abilities. Broll was unarmed and clad simply, in plain brown leather, save for a pair of wide pauldrons that seemed to be fashioned from the claws of some massive beast. Deep emerald green hair, mingling with his thick beard, cascaded down to his shoulders.
The introduction seemed to ask for reciprocation, so Kamery briefly introduced the three of them. “We haven’t met the Marshal here yet,” she admitted, wondering if Windsor was the recently-missing Marshal, or his replacement. “We were sent to thin out the black dragon-kin out here.”
Broll looked around at the nearly empty plains. “It seems you have done well at that.”</Text>

            <Title>The Deadmines</Title>
            <Synopsis>- A few more skirmishes with Defias
- Giant reaper (first boss fight)</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn gestured the others behind her, and felt Kamery and Elthas fade back into the shadows. Bryna and Carolyn stood to one side, out of the direct line of the door, and Raynn turned back to the door. The construction seemed Goblin, rather than Gnomish, but the theory was the same. Passing through Tinkertown every time she had visited Ironforge, she had often been distracted by the Gnomes’ grand designs. Although she had no talent, or interest, in pursuing such things herself, she had picked up a few basic principles. A strong push to just the right spot, and the heavy door swung open easily.
Raynn held her shield up defensively as she stepped forward, scanning the tunnel beyond. She could hear the sounds of mining from below, and other sounds that hinted at more Goblin mechanisms, perhaps not as benign as a door. She felt, rather than saw, Kamery move up past her, and followed the rogue.
Her heart pounded with the familiar anticipation of combat. The skirmish outside had just been the beginning, she was sure, and she relished the opportunity to face more foes. There was something about combat that made her blood sing—the dance of steel, relying on her physical abilities, and the chance to just live in the moment and let her past disappear.
Kamery directed their way down a wide tunnel. Past the first bend, they encountered more miners and their Defias overseers; once again, the miners scattered as they fought past the Defias. After several more turns, and several more skirmishes, they reached another door, this one standing open to reveal a more finished room, with a metal floor.
Entering at the rogue’s signal, Raynn realized that the floor was a platform. To the left, a wide ramp spiraled downwards around the outer wall; a solid half-wall on its outer edge obscured the floor below. In the middle of this cavernous chamber hung a massive crucible, filling the foundry with the familiar scent of molten iron.
Raynn felt a pang of longing, as she thought of her half-finished gauntlets, waiting back at Dane’s forge. She had been in the midst of making them when Kamery had requested her assistance. Dane had shooed her away, reminding her that the gauntlets would be there when she returned, but if she didn’t go, the rogue might not return.
Gripping the handle of her shield and the hilt of her sword firmly, Raynn swiftly descended the ramp. As she neared the bottom, a new sound rose over the hissing and crackling of the iron—a mechanical clacking.
Kamery and Elthas slipped ahead, alert, although the druid’s whiskers twitched uncomfortably. They returned a moment later, Kamery’s face pale above her bandanna.
“Reaper,” she whispered. “A big one.”
The rogue had pointed out the mechanical reapers in the fields above. Originally designed to assist in harvesting crops, they now menaced the farmers, reprogrammed by the Defias to attack anyone who approached them. Raynn nodded grimly. “We have to get past it.” She glanced back at the two spell-casters who followed them. “Stay away from its blades.”
Bryna’s expression indicated that she had had no intention of going anywhere near the blades anyway. Carolyn nodded, her expression unreadable, and spoke a word of power. Raynn felt holy fortitude fill her, bolstering her strength. Elthas made a strange, startled sound, and suddenly a second surge of power swept over the group.
“Sorry,” Elthas’s mumble emerged from the panther’s throat. “I always forget.” He sounded sheepish.
“Ready?” Raynn asked, looking over the group once more. They had worked well together in their fights so far, but this was more than just a handful of ill-equipped ruffians. The others nodded, their faces set in determination.
Taking a deep breath, Raynn charged forward, rounding the corner to confront the reaper. The thing was huge, taller than she was, with blades almost as long as her body. It attacked immediately, responding to its reprogramming. She ducked under the first slice and brought her sword up to parry the next. She saw her companions move in to attack, but the reaper forced her attention back with another flurry of blades.
Studying its movements, Raynn soon found the pattern. She had faced similar mechanical foes in the area around Gnomeregan, the Gnomes’ deserted homeland. Limited by their programming, they always had a set pattern of attacks. Meeting it became a dance of repetition. Duck, parry, block, repeat.
Her arm ached with the repeated blows, but warmth from Carolyn’s healing fended off the pain. She noted with satisfaction that the priestess stayed well back from the whirling blades. The fight became almost hypnotic, fending off the reaper’s single-minded attention.
Raynn felt the bursts of cold as Bryna’s spells flew overhead, following a well-ordered pattern—smaller icicles followed by larger bolts of frost. Kamery and Elthas wove their attacks seamlessly behind the mechanism, which started to falter as its parts began to seize up.
Raynn blocked another swing, noting that they were slower and becoming more erratic. She managed to land several blows herself, as Kamery and Elthas continued to dismantle the reaper from behind with ruthless efficiency. With one final frost-bolt from Bryna, it shuddered to a complete halt.
Raynn watched the mechanism for a moment, to make sure that it was truly out of commission, then looked at her companions, and saw that their faces reflected her own feelings—the rush of battle fading into satisfaction.
Raynn nodded, a slight smile on her face. “Good fight.”</Text>

            <Title>Airborn Reflections</Title>
            <Synopsis>On her flight to Westfall, Raynn has some internal reflections on her past.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The sun blazed high overhead, bathing the fallow fields of Westfall in warm light. The white watchtower of Sentinel Hill shone in the distance, a beacon of Stormwind’s influence in this border territory. The smell of the nearby sea filled the air, fresh and sharp with a salty tang.
Flying overhead on a hired gryphon, Raynn reveled in the familiar feeling of the wind on her face, blowing her ponytail out behind her. She didn’t ride much these days—the gryphon masters of Stormwind had trained their charges well, and they would only fly where their master directed them.
Although her first such flight had returned her to the comfort of Ironforge four years ago, she had chafed at the restriction. She missed having control over the mount herself, as she had in her youth in Aerie Peak.
The Wildhammer Dwarves there had taken her in as a young foster, when she’d had nowhere else to go, not long after her life had been completely shattered. She had enjoyed her time with them, learning combat techniques, blacksmithing, and gryphon riding. The three happy years had ended abruptly though. That, Raynn knew, she had brought on herself, but—despite upending her life again—she had no regrets for her actions that fateful day in Southshore.
As the well-trained gryphon circled in to land at its familiar perch, the approaching ground  pushed away her turbulent memories, bringing her thoughts back to the current moment. The flight had saved her hours of overland travel, and she decided that despite the lack of freedom, even the restricted flights had their merits. Dismounting in the small gryphon yard, the feel of her iron boots landing on solid ground dispelled the last of Raynn’s reminiscences. 
She looked around the town that had grown up around the watchtower; the solid stone tower dominated, of course. Surrounding it were a handful of small wooden cottages with thatched roofs; smoke from several of the chimneys drifted on the wind, lending the air a faint acrid smell. On the edge of town, a lumber mill stood, now quiet and idle. A larger building opposite the entrance of the tower must be the inn that Kamery had mentioned.
The thought of the rogue brought conflicting feelings to Raynn. She had been a bit surprised when the young woman had come to see her at the forge, although in hindsight, she shouldn’t have been. Kamery had hinted at future partnerships on their way to Westbrook. She had also asked questions that had discomfited Raynn. Memories were fine in the freedom of the air. On the ground, she preferred to focus on the present.
Kamery’s questions had seemed innocent enough, but there had been a disconcerting perceptiveness in the young rogue’s gaze. She had proposed a worthy quest though, telling Raynn that she had uncovered the headquarters of the Defias Brotherhood. Although once members of the Stonemason’s Guild that had rebuilt Stormwind, the Defias had turned to criminal activity, and now posed a threat to the city’s security. Kamery had needed assistance in taking down their leadership.
Raynn smiled to herself as she remembered the rogue’s uncomfortable shuffle at that admission. The woman was fiercely independent, a feeling that Raynn understood too well. There was value in teamwork though, and she eagerly anticipated fighting as part of a group again. She was particularly swayed by Kamery’s mention of her sister, a priestess, who would be joining them.
Pushing aside her lingering doubts and memories, Raynn turned towards the inn, where Kamery had said to meet. She wondered if the rogue had arrived yet, as she approached the sprawling two-story building. The inn looked as though it had undergone several expansions; the dark beams criss-crossing the whitewashed wood of its walls didn’t always align at the corners. Like all of the cottages, the roof was thatched with brown straw, with a stone chimney that emitted lazy swirls of smoke and hope of a warm meal.</Text>

            <Title>Southshore - Raynn</Title>
            <Text>Raynn soared gracefully above the Hillsbrad Foothills on her trusted gryphon, a familiar routine patrol over the lands of the humans. The world below appeared serene and at peace, a stark contrast to the turbulence that had marked her earlier years.
Abruptly, the tranquility shattered as a startling sight unfolded beneath her. Orcs swarmed the dockyards of Southshore, a scene she hadn't anticipated in the least. Confusion mingled with curiosity as she observed the loading of orcish warriors onto ships tethered to the docks. It was an unexpected disruption, a glimpse into a world she thought she knew well.
A shadow passing at the edge of her vision drew her attention, and she turned to witness a human army advancing from Durnholde Keep. The collision between the two forces seemed inevitable, and Raynn's heart quickened with the realization that she was caught in the middle of an impending clash.
Guiding her gryphon lower, she descended towards a small copse of trees. The rustling leaves and creaking branches accompanied her landing as she concealed her gryphon, attuning herself to the rhythmic footfalls of the approaching humans.
With a determined resolve, Raynn approached the stern-faced human commander, assuming the guise of just another local resident caught in the turmoil. She couldn't bear the thought of witnessing another one-sided confrontation, especially with this one skewed in favor of the well-armed humans.
&quot;Good day, sir,&quot; she greeted the commander, carefully choosing her words. &quot;You should know, I saw an orc army marching northward not long ago.&quot;
Subtly leaning on the tensions between the orcs and the nobles of Alterac, she let the insinuation linger, her eyes meeting the commander's with a facade of distress masking her true feelings.
&quot;An orc killed my parents,&quot; she confided, allowing the buried anger to surface. The human commander, softened by her apparent grief, nodded, his suspicions overshadowed by sympathy. &quot;Don't worry, miss. We'll handle this. You did a good thing reporting it.&quot;
As the humans diverted north, Raynn stood watching their departure. No guilt for the deception burdened her; instead, a disdain for the humans' continued hatred for orcs simmered within her. The petty animosity only reinforced her belief that humans and their prejudiced attitudes were responsible for her parents' tragic fate.
Raynn stood there, watching the last remnants of the human army disappear on the northern horizon. The sense of impending danger lingered in the air as the landscape settled into an eerie calm. It wasn't long before the rhythmic thuds of approaching war wolves disrupted the quiet.
Thrall and Grom rode up to her, their imposing figures casting shadows in the fading daylight. Grom, with his characteristic bluntness, wasted no time.
&quot;You come with us, human,&quot; he declared.
Thrall, ever composed, nodded his agreement, his piercing eyes fixing on Raynn. The weight of their presence pressed upon her, and a momentary hesitation gripped her.
Grom sensed her uncertainty and moved to clarify, his voice carrying the weight of obligation. &quot;The humans will realize your deception soon enough. When they find the orcs have escaped, their anger will turn to you.&quot;
Raynn considered Grom's words, her mind racing through the potential consequences. The Wildhammers, loyal though they were, wouldn't risk their alliance with the Alliance to shelter her. The bitter truth settled, and she agreed with Grom's predictions.
&quot;I'll go with you,&quot; she stated, her decision made. The past few years among the dwarves had been enjoyable, but the memories of her parents' fate lingered, stoking the cold anger within her.
Grom's expression softened with a nod of approval. The urgency of the situation prompted quick action. Raynn, gathering her resolve, scribbled a terse note to the Wildhammers, explaining the sudden turn of events. Tying the note to her gryphon's saddle, she sent the bird back to Aerie Peak.
With a shared purpose, Thrall, Grom, and Raynn rode back to Southshore, where the ships loomed like silent behemoths ready to embark on a voyage into the unknown. The air buzzed with anticipation and uncertainty as they boarded their respective ships, leaving the contentious lands of the Eastern Kingdoms behind.
The orcs set sail, guided by the winds of the unknown, while Raynn's gaze lingered on the disappearing shores, contemplating the journey that lay ahead.</Text>

            <Title>Back in Stormwind</Title>
            <Text>Lily's heart pounded as the portal's energies enveloped her, unexpected and overwhelming. One moment, she was standing alongside Anduin and Dr. Sparks, and the next, she felt a disorienting whirlwind of colors and sensations.

The transition was swift and disconcerting. Lily stumbled out of the portal on the other side, landing on unfamiliar cobblestone streets. Blinking away the residual dizziness, she took in her surroundings. The architecture was grand and medieval, nothing like the bustling cityscape of her world.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Lily wondered aloud, glancing around with a mix of awe and confusion.

Dr. Sparks emerged from the portal shortly after, her expression mirroring Lily's astonishment. &quot;Well, this wasn't exactly what I had in mind. Azeroth, huh? This is incredible!&quot;

Anduin, recognizing the unintended passengers, approached them with a mixture of concern and gratitude. &quot;I didn't mean for this to happen. You both shouldn't have been pulled into this.&quot;

Lily managed a small smile, trying to ease the tension. &quot;No worries, Anduin. We're here now. Let's just figure out how to get back, okay?&quot;

As they navigated the foreign streets of Stormwind, Lily marveled at the towering structures and the fantastical atmosphere. She couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement despite the unforeseen circumstances.

Dr. Sparks, ever the curious inventor, examined the portal device with a furrowed brow. &quot;I need some time to recalibrate and figure out what went wrong. In the meantime, let's explore this world! I've never seen anything like it.&quot;

Anduin, still burdened by the responsibility of his realm, sighed. &quot;I appreciate your enthusiasm, but we need to resolve this as quickly as possible. Azeroth is facing threats, and I cannot afford to be distracted.&quot;

Lily, torn between the fascination of this new realm and the urgency of returning home, nodded in understanding. Together, they embarked on a journey to find a solution, their bonds strengthening amidst the challenges presented by the melding of worlds.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Ambassador Flamelash
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Fortified by a good meal, and better news, the group rallied to continue their infiltration of the Dark Iron city, as the now-open rear exit of the Grim Guzzler allowed passage to the deeper halls. The doorway led out into a circular balcony that overlooked a great anvil in the center of the city.
Dwarven homes ringed the wide ledge, with doorways on their level, and two and three floors of windows carved into the rock walls above. The ever-present braziers of glowing embers added to the incandescence of the lake of magma far below.
Using the anvil to orient himself from his earlier explorations, Elthas was glad that he hadn’t approached closer; the elemental guardian radiated heat that he could feel even at this distance. Luckily, it didn’t notice them above its post, as they circled around the perimeter.
Despite a couple of scuffles with Dark Iron Dwarves along the way, they quickly reached another ramp, leading further down into the city. Varian and Broll led the way, having received directions from the helpful bartender.
Descending lower, the air became even warmer and more oppressive, and Elthas’s whiskers twitched at the sulfuric odor in the air. A breath of a breeze surprised him, as they rounded a corner in the hallway and emerged into a large square room.
The back of the chamber was open, showcasing a wide chasm, rough stone walls, and oozing streams of red-orange magma. Raised runes, regularly spaced around the edges of the room, decorated the solid iron floor. To their left, another passageway continued downwards.
An angry hiss sounded from their right, and Elthas was glad that he had been prowling unseen in the shadows with Kamery. An orange-scaled Flamewalker slithered into view from behind an outcropping of rock, carrying a wicked trident whose tip glowed fiery red with enchantment.
Although his body resembled a massive upright snake, he had broad shoulders and muscular arms which were covered with long horns at intervals all along their lengths. More horns rose from his head, above an angular face that was twisted with hatred.
The Flamewalker attacked swiftly, but Raynn stepped forward, her shield already at the ready. She caught the blow easily, deflecting it aside. The fight seemed destined to settle into their well-practiced choreography, but the Flamewalker had a surprise in store for his opponents.
Carolyn was the first to notice, calling out “Elementals!” as several flame elementals rose from runes at the outer edges of the room. As the elementals converged on the Flamewalker, he cackled evilly, drawing streams of fiery, elemental energy from them. Radiating heat poured over the group, and the odor of singed hair tickled Elthas’s nostrils.
Even as the melee combatants assessed the new threat, a sudden, surprising swirl of snow stymied the flow of fire. Beside Carolyn, Bryna’s arms were raised and her face was locked in determined concentration. Although Elthas felt only a light chill as the magical blizzard swirled faster and thicker, one by one the fire elementals flickered out and the Flamewalker subsided to his original size.
Returning his focus to the single opponent, Elthas allowed his predatory instincts to take control and guide his claws to where they would do the most damage. The Flamewalker thrashed desperately, but only seemed to enrage Varian more. The Human King’s twin swords sliced down with deadly effect.
At the Flamewalker’s fall, Elthas shifted out of feline form, which helped him to regain control over his instincts. As the adrenaline of combat faded, he felt the healing warmth of Carolyn’s group spell pass over him, mending the minor wounds that he hadn’t noticed in the heat of combat.</Text>

            <Title>The Gates of Stormwind</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Windsor convinces General Marcus Jonathan to let them pass
</Synopsis>
            <Text>The small band led by Varian approached the gates of Stormwind. Raynn looked up at the soaring arches of white stone, impressed as always by the architecture of the sprawling city. From the solid walls rising high overhead to the deep water filling the valley approach, the city was well-defended.
A wide bridge crossed the lake, lined along both sides with statues of the fallen heroes of Stormwind. The gates at the far end were usually open to visitors, but today they were guarded by a line of city guardsmen, led by a soldier on horseback.
When he saw them approaching, the horseman rode out to intercept them mid-span. “I cannot let you pass. I have orders to arrest you and the impostor as traitors.” His eyes rested on Varian.
Marshal Windsor stepped forward, his hands spread open in front of him, to address the horseman. “General Jonathan, Marcus, we served together under Turalyon. He made us both the men that we are today. Did he err with me? Do you truly believe my intent is to cause harm to our Alliance?”
Turalyon was one of those statues, Raynn knew; one of the first paladins, and a hero of the Second War. Although he had been a key figure in the defeat, and subsequent internment, of the Orcs, he had done so to protect his people and reclaim their lands around Stormwind.
She wasn’t the only one lost in memory, as Marcus Jonathan bowed his head and admitted, “I do not know what to do anymore.” The General looked once more at Varian, whose stormy eyes bored into him with regal determination. Conflict evident on his face, Marcus continued, “The nobles, they fill our lives with endless lies.”
“You must do what you think is right, Marcus,” Windsor counseled his old friend.
With a nod, Marcus straightened and turned to his men. “Stand down! Heroes walk among us. Let them pass.” Turning to a young squire, he instructed the boy to pass the word through the city.
The guards stepped to either side, and the committed group made their way into the city, heading for the confrontation at the Keep.</Text>

            <Text>As she watched the interchange between Bryna and King Varian, Kamery smiled beneath her bandanna. The King’s anger at Fordragon’s dismissal was gratifying. This was the Varian she had been disappointed to hear had not returned to Stormwind months ago. This man, it seemed, did care about his kingdom’s safety.
At the King’s question, Bryna’s lips curled in a familiar smirk. However, before she could react, Elthas shifted out of his feline form to say, “I recognize him, from Alcaz.”
Everyone turned to stare at the druid, and Kamery wondered if the Kaldorei would start licking his hand, which was his panther’s usual reaction to attention. The thought was fleeting though, as she remembered back to their stealthy investigation of the island. Elthas had picked up a scent there, a trail that led from a prison cell to a magic circle, then split to lead in two directions.
“The one that split?” she asked for confirmation.
Elthas nodded.
“What is he talking about?” King Varian asked, looking at Broll, but the elder druid looked just as confused. Kamery explained their findings and the King nodded. “I escaped over a cliff that night.”
“What of the other trail, the one that led to the dock?” Elthas asked, frowning.
But the King couldn’t answer; his memories of that night were still fragmented and the scene had been confusing. Broll laid a reassuring hand on his friend’s shoulder, and King Varian’s attention returned to the present.
Seeing his face tighten again, Bryna interjected, holding up her official deputization papers. “We’re the help Fordragon sent.”
At Varian’s expression of disbelief, Raynn’s chin raised in proud defiance. “We’re enough,” she stated flatly, her companions nodding in agreement.
Varian wasn’t convinced though, protesting, “It’s the Dark Iron stronghold.”
“I’ve faced Dark Irons before,” Kamery addressed the concern nonchalantly.
“They likely have fire elementals also, that close to the Molten Core,” Broll added, frowning.
“Those too,” Kamery shrugged. At their looks of disbelief, she reached into her pack and showed them Infernus’s bracers.
Broll’s eyes widened at the sight of the ornate elemental bands. “Well,” he admitted. “They may be enough.” Varian’s frown barely lessened, but he nodded briefly.</Text>

            <Title>Voices</Title>
            <Synopsis>The five adventurers gather in Mathias Shaw's office - all five perspectives.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Premise:
Mathias Shaw met with the five adventurers in his office on top of the SI:7 headquarters building in Stormwind. Raynn was a lean, strong warrior, who took pride in her blacksmithing skill. She was not from Stormwind, and did not like talking about, or even thinking about, her past. Kamery was a rogue who had worked for Shaw for several years now. She was observant and a strong strategic thinker. Carolyn was Kamery’s twin sister, although they differed in appearance and personality. Carolyn was a priestess, with a peaceful and calm demeanor, with a streak of stubborn determination. Elthas was a druid, young for his people, with an enthusiastic and energetic outlook on life. He preferred his feline form, especially amongst the shorter races. Bryna was a mage, whose casual and relaxed appearance covered an observant and mercurial mind.
Raynn:
Raynn stood stiffly at the top of the stairs leading down from Matthias Shaw’s office. Shaw had asked them there for a briefing on a new mission. Hoping that the meeting would be short, she looked around at her friends, carefully avoiding Shaw and Kamery’s too-curious, too-observant eyes. Shaw stood at the window, as usual, with Carolyn between Raynn and the spy-master. The talented priestess stood calmly, a peaceful smile on her face. On Shaw’s other side, Kamery flanked her superior. Her short dark hair and black leather stood in stark contrast to Carolyn’s blonde hair and white and purple robes. Her well-honed daggers were also a contrast to her sister’s staff, although Raynn reflected bemusedly that both sisters seemed quite adept at wielding their weapons of choice. Next to Kamery, Bryna stood, her posture relaxed. Her staff was nowhere in sight, but Raynn knew that the mage’s spells were close at hand, if necessary. Elthas, in feline form as always, prowled restlessly behind Bryna and Kamery, occasionally earning a sharp glance from Shaw when he ventured too close to the spy-master’s heavy desk. Raynn was certain that the papers scattered on its surface were of no importance. Anything sensitive would be carefully locked away. She reflected that the group worked well together in combat, and hoped that their upcoming mission would allow them to do so again.
Kamery:
Kamery stood quietly next to Shaw, her eyes taking in the assembled group. On the other side of Shaw, Carolyn was smiling peacefully. She was glad that her sister was taking this covert business in stride now. It was wonderful to be able to work together so often now, and Carolyn’s healing was a huge boost to the group. Pride flowed through her at how far her sister had progressed in her studies. The usual recipient of Caro’s healing stood next to her, as if using the priestess as a shield to separate herself from Shaw. Kamery noted that Raynn also stood closest to the stairs. Was that on purpose? The warrior’s confidence showed in her pose, straight and tall, although perhaps a bit too rigid now—she was uncomfortable around the perceptive master of SI:7. Some day, she’ll tell us what she’s hiding. For now, she’s an effective ally. Beside Raynn, Bryna was a contrast in attitudes. Her posture was relaxed and easy, the brim of her bright red hat shielding her eyes. Eyes that, Kamery had realized, didn’t miss much. Bryna could easily have trained for SI:7 herself, if she hadn’t been so magically gifted. Behind her, Kamery could feel Elthas’s constant movement, pausing only at the occasional silent reprimand from Shaw. He’s getting too close to that desk, not that there’s anything to hide on there. Kamery felt her lips curve against her black bandanna as she thought about the exuberant druid’s antics. He probably feels cooped up in this room.

Carolyn:
Carolyn’s gaze drifted around the small room, taking in her friends. Beside her, Shaw was preparing to brief them on another mission. On her other side, Raynn stood tall and proud. She had a new shield, and Carolyn wondered if that was the source of her pride. The shield held some powerful enchantments, and she looked forward to seeing how well it did in battle. Perhaps, she wondered with bemusement, she would be able to join the melee. She knew that Raynn disproved her doing so, but she also knew that she was careful to avoid unnecessary damage to herself, and she enjoyed the exertion—why should the warrior and rogue have all the fun? At the thought of the rogue, she let her gaze drift to her sister. Kamery’s grey eyes were also moving about the room, taking in the group, and probably watching for threats, although Carolyn wasn’t sure who would be able to threaten the master of SI:7 in his own office. Carolyn was glad to be reunited with her sister now, and working together, but she did still miss the Kaldorei lands sometimes. She did have her Kaldorei best friend with her here though, she reflected, glancing over at Elthas, prowling near Shaw’s desk in his favored feline form. The druid was rarely still, and she knew he was enjoying exploring the room, while also eager to start on whatever next adventure Shaw had in store for them. Elthas passed behind Bryna’s simply-clad legs, and Carolyn was once again reminded of the lackadaisical mage’s tailoring talent. Her simple clothing was entirely illusion, covering intricate and powerful enchantments. Carolyn had learned a lot from Bryna, and her parents, who owned a tailoring shop here in Stormwind. She wondered what the mage was thinking, but her eyes were shadowed below the brim of her hat, and unreadable.

Elthas:
The sharp scent of fresh ink mingled with the dusty smell of older missives as Elthas prowled slowly back and forth across the open space in the room. It was an interesting combination, and he moved closer to the desk to investigate. A slight clearing of Shaw’s throat interrupted his hunt, and he paused momentarily, chagrined. Shaw was standing with his Human friends between the window and the staircase that led down out of the room. The spy-master was looking reprovingly at Elthas, and he shifted his gaze to the side. Beside Shaw, Carolyn stood with a calmness that belied her stubborn nature. As he often did when she appeared so peaceful, Elthas found himself remembering their first meeting, when she had cheerfully charged into battle with sprites, swinging her staff with unexpected skill. They had connected almost instantly, and he had followed her all the way to Stormwind, at her sister’s request. That sister, Kamery, stood to Shaw’s other side, darkness where Carolyn was light, but no different in their determination to do what was right. Across from Kamery, Raynn stood at the top of the stairs, stiff and solemn. The scent of heated metal and flux clung to her, and Elthas wondered what new piece of armor she was wearing now. Flexing and stretching his muscles, resuming his slow pacing, he wondered how she could bear wearing such weight and still move in combat. He angled his path now, aiming between the desk and the final member of their group, Bryna. The mage, as always, shimmered with magical power. Her clothing was part of it, but the majority was within her. She was becoming more adept at using it, and he knew that she had learned a few new portal spells recently. He couldn’t wait to explore more new places. But first, the desk. His path had taken him close enough now, and Shaw was beginning his briefing; Elthas’s whiskers twitched eagerly as he turned back towards the interesting scents that came from the lower drawer.

Bryna:
Studious adopting a pose of relaxed ease, Bryna once again took stock of the unlikely group of friends. Raynn, stiff as always, perhaps even more so in Shaw’s presence. The man’s curiosity unnerved the warrior, which in turn made Bryna herself curious. The warrior was competent, but she hid too much about her past. One day, the nightmares would manifest in combat, and Bryna hoped that they could survive it. Of course, Carolyn, standing next to Raynn now, would see to that. The priestess had become quite powerful—she didn’t flaunt it, but Bryna had noticed that when the group fought, they almost always emerged unscathed, yet Carolyn showed no signs of fatigue. Her endurance and skill in spell usage were impressive. Bryna wished that she had Carolyn’s levels of endurance herself, as she often felt herself waning after longer battles and needed to rest, or use potions or spells to reinvigorate herself. Elthas had one such spell that he could use on them, and given how often he used it on Bryna herself, she knew that he wasn’t helping Carolyn. And of course, he didn’t help heal, given that he never shifted out of feline form. His claws, like Kamery’s daggers, were effective weapons in close combat. She felt his soft fur brush up against her leg briefly, and that, along with Shaw’s sharp glances past her legs, told her that he was prowling behind her. She turned her attention to Kamery instead, amusement twitching her lips at the contrast between the two sisters. Carolyn had long, up-swept, blonde-haired and wore long, intricately embroidered, white and purple robes. Kamery wore her dark hair cropped short, and dressed in black leather from her nose to the tips of her toes. Her grey eyes were quicker than Carolyn’s, constantly taking in their surroundings while the priestess was focused more on Shaw. The parts, Bryna reflected, were starting to add up to the whole.</Text>

            <Title>Blood Oath - Raynn</Title>
            <Text>In the shadow of a battered tent, Raynn crouched low, her heart pounding like the distant drums of war. Hidden, she strained to understand the guttural orcish words exchanged between Grom and Thrall. The aching bruises on her parents' faces served as a brutal reminder of the cost of understanding, of bearing witness.
Thrall, stern and resolute, his green-skinned face etched with determination, questioned Grom. &quot;What has transpired here?&quot; Thrall's gaze flickered towards the lifeless forms of Ellis and Lysandra.
Grom, his towering frame silhouetted against the waning light, responded with a heavy solemnity, &quot;They were near death, Thrall. Beaten. I offered the man a quick end. Before he died, he made me swear to find and protect his child.&quot;
Thrall's gaze narrowed, concern etching his features. &quot;A child, Grom? In the midst of our war-band? It is no place for a human. They won't survive among us. We are on a mission to liberate our people.&quot;
Grom, undeterred, spoke with a determination that echoed through the camp, &quot;Thrall, it's a matter of honor. A blood oath. I won't break it.&quot;
Thrall, torn between duty and compassion, hesitated, the gravity of the situation sinking in. Grom's next words cut through the air like a blade. &quot;A blood oath, Thrall.&quot;
Acknowledging the weight of Grom's oath, Thrall gave a reluctant nod. &quot;Very well, Grom. But the risks are great. We must be cautious.&quot;
As Grom and Thrall rode towards the Thandol Span, Raynn's fate became intertwined with theirs. The promise of protection echoed in the air, a pledge forged in the crucible of war. The journey ahead, obscured by uncertainty, held the echoes of the orcish code of honor and the weight of promises made under the shadow of death.</Text>

            <Title>Back to the Forge</Title>
            <Text>The white stone walls of Stormwind rose up to engulf the group as they flew in on their hired gryphons. Raynn wondered if she would ever look at the city the same way again. Every stone was now a reminder of the wounds of her companions. A chill ran through her as she remembered the arrow piercing Carolyn’s shoulder, the blood matting Elthas’s fur, the single-minded pursuit of Kamery. He had refused to back down, refused to surrender to face justice. The city’s shining walls and towers were now overshadowed by the cost of their construction.
Dismounting, the group moved as one, away from the busy gryphon master’s post, and deeper into the streets of the city. Raynn looked at the others, wondering what they were thinking. Bryna answered her question unknowingly.
“I knew about the riots,” the mage mused, “but I never realized just how bad things had gotten since.”
“Riots?” Elthas asked, his brow furrowed. He hadn’t shifted back to feline form since the gryphon ride, which would have been impossible in an animal form.
Raynn nodded, remembering the histories that she had read. “The Stonemasons rebuilt Stormwind after the wars. They demanded too much in payment. When they were denied, they rioted.”
Kamery cleared her throat, interjecting, “They were offered a pittance, far less than they had previously been promised.”
Raynn raised an eyebrow. That hadn’t been in the histories. Then again, the history books had been written for the House of Nobles, the very group who had refused the Stonemasons.
“It’s something in between both,” Bryna clarified. “The House of Nobles refused to pay the agreed amount, true, but the Stonemasons demanded far too much afterwards also. The riots though, that was the final straw.”
Carolyn took up the tale when Bryna paused. “The House of Nobles disbanded the Stonemasons. They rioted, and the Queen was killed.” She shook her head sadly, eyes unfocused in reminiscence.
“The surviving Stonemasons fled Stormwind for Westfall, where they formed the Defias.” Kamery concluded, bringing the story full-circle.
“King Varian would never forgive them,” Bryna added.
Elthas’s golden eyes widened, and Raynn was glad that she hadn’t been the only one who hadn’t known the full story.
They stood for a moment, amidst the bustle of the thriving city, in quiet contemplation. Kamery’s sense of duty soon got the best of her though, and she broke the reverie, saying, “I’d better report back to Shaw.”
Raynn felt her muscles tense at the mention of the SI:7 spy master. Kamery had become a close ally over the past few days, but now she was reminded of the young rogue’s true allegiances. Even Elthas’s innocent curiosity set her on edge, now that they were beyond the heat of battle.
“I should get back to Dane,” she made her excuses. “I have a new pair of gauntlets to finish!” Her heartbeat quickened as she thought of the almost-finished gloves.
As she walked along the canal towards the Dwarven District, Raynn’s mind lingered on the past few days. They had come together well in a short time, fighting as one cohesive group. Raynn’s heart swelled at the memories, despite her now-conflicted thoughts about VanCleef and the Defias. The former Stonemasons had gone too far, that was certain. But at the same time, she understood hopelessness and fighting against injustice with desperation. Memories of Thrall flooded her mind, of the Orcish Warchief’s quest to liberate his people.
Thrall had fought with honor though, Raynn reminded herself, remembering the Defias dreadnought filled with explosives that she and her companions had destroyed. And the Warchief had fought only when he had no other option. He had offered the internment camps a choice; it was the Humans who had refused him and forced his hand. Who had—no, she couldn’t think about her parents now. Cold anger ran through her as she crossed the final bridge. She needed the blacksmithing hammer more than ever now, to pour her feelings into the metal instead.
The atmosphere of the Dwarven District was instantly soothing, reminding her of the happier times that had followed all of the turmoil. The gruff voices of Dwarves and the higher-pitched voices of Gnomes mingling together in a familiar harmony. The smokiness in the air was comforting, although it lacked the crispness of Ironforge and Dun Morogh. Even the buildings were less imposing, comprised mostly of wood and plaster, rather than the white stone of the rest of the city.
Dane seemed to sense her mood, as he stood back and allowed her to work silently. The finishing work was more delicate than her thoughts wanted, but she forced herself to keep her movements deliberate, precise. She wanted these gauntlets to be perfect more than she needed to give her rage an outlet.
The bustle of the Dwarven District faded as she worked, each stroke of the hammer adding a final detail to the armor. Dane had taught her not only how to shape the metal, but also how to add enchantments into the work, mostly using crushed gems as reagents to mix with the iron. The cuffs of the gauntlets shimmered with a faint opalescence, and Raynn took a moment to admire the work, before she hammered in the last few rivets.
Slipping the now-finished gauntlets on her hands, Raynn flexed her fingers. She savored the subtle whisper of the articulating iron, almost lost in the creak of the new leather, as they seamlessly conformed to her movements. After allowing herself a moment of proud satisfaction, she stepped to a deserted corner of the smith’s area. Drawing her sword, she began to run through a precise practice routine.
“Lass!” Dane’s voice broke her concentration. She smiled at his address. Although not a Dwarf himself, the man had spent even more time with them than she had, and had picked up many of their patterns of speech. She looked over to see what warranted his call, and saw a familiar face.</Text>

            <Text>As they rode south out of the town to the snow-covered main road, a roar sounded in the distance. Carolyn’s moonsaber hesitated, its ears swiveling. Elthas noticed, and paused at the side of the road. Their route lay eastward, to their left, while to their right the road split north, west, and east; the three-way intersection marked with an obelisk of rough-stacked stones in the middle.
Shifting out of his cheetah form, Elthas looked along the northern road as he spoke, “Wild frostsabers. Cousins to the moonsaber.” Gesturing at Carolyn’s mount, he interpreted, “I think he wants to greet them.” His own face held hope of the same.
Carolyn hesitated, knowing the urgency of their task, but Bryna waved her away. “Go.” The mage smirked. “It won’t take all five of us to talk to this dragon.”
Carolyn and Elthas turned up the northward trail, while Bryna, Kamery, and Raynn continued to the east.</Text>

Show, Don’t Tell: What You Need to Know
2 Aug 2023  The Writing Craft

You’ve heard this writing advice a thousand times, and you’ll hear it a thousand times more:
Show, don’t tell.
But what does it mean?
If you struggle with the difference between showing and telling, you’re not alone. Once you’ve got it, it seems simple. But until you do, learning this technique can be as frustrating as anything in the writing world.
Is it really that important? You bet it is. If you want your writing noticed by an agent or a publisher, it’s vital you master the art of showing.
So let’s see if I can solidify the concept in your mind right here, right now.
I want to supercharge your showing vs. telling radar—and make it simple.
Need help fine-tuning your writing? Click here to download my FREE self-editing checklist.
The Difference Between Showing and Telling
When you tell rather than show, you inform your reader of information rather than allowing him to deduce anything.
You’re supplying information by simply stating it. You might report that a character is “tall,” or “angry,” or “cold,” or “tired.”
That’s telling.
Showing paints a picture the reader can see in her mind’s eye.
Here’s how to show and not tell:
If your character is tall, your reader can deduce that because you mention others looking up when they talk with him.
Or he has to duck to get through a door. Or when posing for a photo, he has to bend his knees to keep his head in proximity with others.
Rather than telling that your character is angry, show it by describing his face flushing, his throat tightening, his voice rising, his slamming a fist on the table. When you show, you don’t have to tell.
Cold? Do not tell me; show me. Your character pulls her collar up, tightens her scarf, shoves her hands deep into her pockets, turns her face away from the biting wind.
Tired? He can yawn, groan, stretch. His eyes can look puffy. His shoulders could slump. Another character might say, “Didn’t you sleep last night? You look shot.”
When you show rather than tell, you make the reader part of the experience. Rather than having everything simply imparted to him, he sees it in his mind and comes to the conclusions you want.
What could be better than engaging your reader—giving him an active role in the story experience?
Examples:
Telling: When they embraced, she could tell he had been smoking and was scared.
Showing: When she wrapped her arms around him, the sweet staleness of tobacco enveloped her, and he shivered.
Telling: The temperature fell and the ice reflected the sun.
Showing: Bill’s nose burned in the frigid air, and he squinted against the sun reflecting off the street.
Telling: Suzie was blind.
Showing: Suzie felt for the bench with a white cane.
Telling: It was late fall.
Showing: Leaves crunched beneath his feet.
Telling: She was a plumber and asked where the bathroom was.
Showing: She wore coveralls, carried a plunger and metal toolbox, and wrenches of various sizes hung from a leather belt. “Point me to the head,” she said.
Telling: I had a great conversation with Tim over dinner and loved hearing his stories.
Showing: I barely touched my food, riveted by Tim. “Let me tell you another story,” he said.
Tips to Help You Avoid Telling
#

Use Dialogue
Riveting dialogue breaks up narrative summary, differentiates characters (through dialect and word choice), and allows a story to emerge naturally, rather than your spelling out every detail.
Instead of telling, with clunky dialogue like this:
“Just because you’re in this hospital because you were nearly killed in that wreck when Bill was driving, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t forgive him.”
Try this:
“What are you going to do about Bill? He feels terrible.”
“He ought to.”
“Well, has he visited?”
“He wouldn’t dare.”
What actually happened can emerge in realistic dialogue as the story progresses.
Participating in the experience is part of the fun of being a reader.
Appeal to Readers’ Senses
There’s nothing quite like the human imagination.
Used wisely, suggestive imagery can help you grab your readers’ attention, transport them to a different world, as long as you don’t draw attention to the writing itself and remind them they’re reading.
Examples:
1. Sight
Starlings soared in dark flocks.
Covered in soot, he carried his son from the blaze.
2. Sound
Thunder rattled the windows.
Laughter broke the silence.
3. Smell
Pumpkin and cinnamon wafted from the kitchen.
She awoke to the aroma of percolating coffee.
4. Taste
Her lips puckered as the lemon touched her tongue.
He savored the fluid yolk of the Eggs Benedict.
5. Touch
The smooth stone felt cool in her palm.
Smooth silk swallowed Rita in the bed.
Use Powerful Verbs
#

Action verbs, as opposed to state-of-being verbs, trigger the theaters of your readers’ minds, allowing them an important role in experiencing your story.
A woman once told me she was thrilled to discover a book she’d cherished as a child. She eagerly thumbed through it, looking for the beautiful paintings she remembered so well, only to discover the book had no illustrations.
The author had so engaged the theater of her young mind that she had imagined those very real impressions.
Here’s a list of 294 powerful verbs with examples you can use as you learn how to show, not tell.
Active Voice Adds Power
To eliminate passive voice, eliminate as many of your state-of-being verbs as possible (is, am, are, was, were, etc.—Google a list and print it).
Examples
Passive: The party was planned by Jill.
Active: Jill planned the party.
Passive: The wedding cake was made by Ben.
Active: Ben made the wedding cake.
Passive: The Little League team was given trophies by the coaches.
Active: The coaches gave trophies to the Little League team.
Click here for my detailed guide on fixing passive voice.
Resist the Urge to Explain (RUE)
Example
She glanced up at the clouds in the sky.
He walked through the open door.
Readers are intelligent. They want to be able to deduce things, not to be led by the nose.
When Telling is Acceptable
Narrative summary is sometimes prudent.
Say you have to get your character to a location where the real action happens.
There’s no need to invest several pages showing every aspect of the trip from packing, dressing, getting a cab to the airport, going through security, boarding the plane, arriving, etc. Rather, it’s okay to you quickly tell it this way:
He flew to Washington, where he…
Then return to showing mode, concentrating on the heart of what happened there.
Show, Don’t Tell Examples
Learn the art of showing (and occasionally telling) from those who’ve done it successfully.
Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier
Some writers make you want to emulate them. Frazier makes me want to surrender and simply read.
“The hay field beyond the beaten dirt of the school playground stood pant-waist high and the heads of grass were turning yellow from need of cutting. The teacher was a round little old man, hairless and pink of face. He owned but one rusty, black suit of clothes and a pair of old overlarge dress boots that curled up at the toes and were so worn down that the heels were wedge-like. He stood at the front of the room rocking on the points.”
The reason it works? Besides the fact that he works the description into the action, he makes you forget you’re reading. That’s the goal.
The Sign of Four by Arthur Conan Doyle
In this novel, Dr. John Watson’s observation of Sherlock Holmes could’ve been boring, but notice how Doyle handles it:
“So swift, silent and furtive were his movements like those of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defense.”
The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien
Describing Mordor, Tolkien leaves no question about its dangers.
“The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light.”
Beloved by Toni Morrison
Morrison brilliantly condenses years into one paragraph of narrative summary:
“Men and women were moved around like checkers. Anybody Baby Suggs knew, let alone loved, who hadn’t run off or been hanged got rented out, loaned out, bought up, brought back, stored up, mortgaged, won, stolen, or seized. So Baby’s eight children had six fathers. What she called the nastiness of life was the stock she received upon learning that nobody stopped playing checkers just because the pieces included her children.”
Why the Book Is Usually Better Than the Movie
The reader’s mind is more imaginative than anything Hollywood can put on the screen. Well-written books trigger readers to create their own visuals.
That’s why it’s worth your time to master the art of showing.

            <Title>Overlord Wyrmthalak</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Trick Wyrmthalak into breathing on the Seal</Synopsis>
            <Text>Bryna lifted her head, studying the disguised red dragon from under the brim of her hat. What exactly, she wondered, did a dragon consider little trouble? Then again, did it matter? They needed his Seal to enter the upper reaches of the spire.
“Back through there?” Kamery asked, looking down the ramp. She and Elthas had returned in time to hear the last part of Vaelan’s pronouncement. Both looked triumphant, but worn, as they handed him the three gems. The stones shimmered with magical potential, but even when Vaelan inserted them into the empty seal, they remained inert.
Raynn looked ready to charge down the ramp anyway, so, remembering Carolyn’s reports of large groups of Orcs and Trolls, Bryna mentally reviewed her polymorph spells.
Vaelan had an alternative, though. “There are ledges, here, and here.” He had his map out again, and was showing Raynn and Kamery his proposed route. Bryna stood to join them, curious.
“Here though”—Kamery indicated a wide hallway—“there were many Orcs living there.”
Nodding, Vaelan revealed the key to his plan, “I can cast an illusion on you, like mine. It will not last long, but it should be enough to get us through there. We will likely face some resistance in Wyrmthalak’s antechamber, but likely not much. He has no love for the Dark Horde; while he will sacrifice any number of them in battle, he prefers to command them from afar.”
“We have no other option,” Raynn pointed out, and Kamery wearily agreed. Carolyn cast a fortifying spell, which seemed to help her and Elthas, and the group followed Vaelan down the ramp and onto a narrow ledge.
The plan worked well, and after a couple of ledges, a nerve-wracking disguised walk, and a highly disturbing number of spiders, scorpids, and scarabs, they reached the upper reaches of this side of the city, where Wyrmthalak resided. Vaelan’s assessment of the Overlord had been correct, and they only had to face a few Orcs as they approached.
The dragonspawn heard them coming, and charged down to meet them. His black-scaled body was armored in red armor, fashioned from some sort of large scales. Noting Vaelan’s narrowed eyes and taut face, Bryna guessed that they might be the scales of red dragon-kin.
Raynn intercepted the Overlord’s charge, deflecting his polearm with her shield as her sword swung in to strike his armor. Gathering frost in her hands, Bryna joined the attack. Beside her, Vaelan did the same with fire, hurling the flaming bolts with deadly accuracy. Kamery and Elthas struck moments later, hitting Wyrmthalak in his less protected hindquarters.
Vaelan had the Seal ready, and as Wyrmthalak reared back, he slid the amulet with its gemstones across the flagstone floor, into the dragonspawn’s flaming breath. To Bryna’s other side, she could hear the murmur of Carolyn’s spells, as the priestess worked to keep Raynn healed through the fiery assault. The warrior’s shield gleamed with the absorbed heat, as she attempted to block the flames.
Gathering another frost-bolt, Bryna hurled it, even as she watched the gemstones in the Seal flare with energy, which then coursed through the golden base. Wyrmthalak also noticed, roaring with rage and hurling his weapon at Vaelan.
The throw was awkward, but powerful, and the weapon embedded in the left shoulder of the red dragon’s Human visage. He stumbled to one knee, reaching up with his right hand to pull the projectile free.
Although now unarmed, Wyrmthalak was still a dangerous foe, and Carolyn’s face was beginning to show the strain, as she tried to heal Vaelan as well as Raynn. Heavy footfalls from behind Bryna told her that the Overlord’s enraged roar had not gone unnoticed.
Turning, the mage saw a pair of Orcs approaching—a warrior and a spell-caster. Drawing a polymorph spell to mind, she swiftly turned the warrior into a porcupine. A quick counter-spell disrupted the Orc spell-caster’s fel incantation, and Bryna’s next frost-bolt struck her in the chest, knocking her back.
A moment later, Kamery struck the caster from the shadows. Bryna blinked at the speed with which the rogue had switched targets; had she learned a short-range teleport spell too? The poisons, frost-bolts, and precise dagger strikes overwhelmed the Orc, and she fell quickly. Kamery slipped back out of sight to return to Wyrmthalak.
Bryna gave a shrug to her porcupine, and also returned her attention to the Overlord. Under the renewed assault, he stumbled. Vaelan was healed now, and casting fireballs once more, and with her opponent disarmed, Raynn was holding her own. Carolyn’s staff swung down, dealing the final blow to the dragonspawn.
As the heat of battle faded, Vaelan scooped up the now-potent Seal. He looked at the porcupine with confusion. “Should we do something about that?”
Bryna shrugged and recast the spell. “It’ll hold for a while. We’re leaving, right?” In her experience, opponents were generally just grateful to be alive rather than pursuing a grudge for very far.
Vaelan nodded, and they returned to the high bridge leading to Wyrmthalak’s chambers. There, he admitted, “I hadn’t actually planned this part.” Glancing back over his shoulder, he sighed. “I was too focused on my enemy. We’ll have to fight back out.”
Looking over the edge of the bridge, Bryna could see the entrance hallway some distance away, but well below them. She did some mental calculations. “We could slow fall from there.” She pointed along a narrow ledge that extended partway along the outer wall of the room they had just come from.
Carolyn’s eyes went wide and her face paled, but she nodded resolutely. The others were also in agreement, so one by one, they filed out onto the ledge. Kamery led the way, her keen eyes and nimble fingers finding handholds, and pointing them out to the others. Carolyn followed, under the watchful eyes of her sister and Elthas, behind her. Bryna and Vaelan went next, with Raynn taking the rear; the warrior guarding their flank, and ready to follow should anyone fall.
Their careful progress went well though, and Bryna cast slow fall on each of them as they reached the end of the ledge. Floating unnoticed over the Dark Horde city, they landed softly back at the entrance to the lower city.</Text>

- sent to Lakeshire to request aid
- Bryna and Elthas volunteer to go
- Kamery, Raynn, Carolyn asked to clear dragon-kin below Morgan's Vigil</Synopsis>
            <Text>After exiting Bryna's portal to Ironforge, the small group made their way quickly towards the gryphon masters near the Great Forge. Raynn paused for a moment with her former blacksmithing master, sharing her new armor with quiet pride. Then, they mounted the tamed gryphons that would take them across the scorched landscapes surrounding Blackrock Mountain to the small fortified camp at Morgan’s Vigil.
The small village on the mountainside had all but been destroyed by the devastation wrought by Ragnaros’s summoning, two hundred years ago. All that remained now were the crumbling ruins of a watchtower and a few burnt-out foundations. The warm air was dry and hazy, carrying a musty, sooty, smell and muffling the distant sounds of the few creatures that could survive in this land.
The few current inhabitants of the outpost had erected several tents amongst the ruins. A crude wooden palisade protected the slope leading to the scorched, open plains below. Their hired gryphons circled in to land just inside the palisade, to the left of the open gate.
As they alighted, sending the gryphons back home, a Kaldorei dressed in light chain mail approached them. Tall, like all of his race, he had long, dirty-blond hair and narrow features, which now carried a rather distracted look even as he addressed them. “Greetings travelers, I am Helendis Riverhorn.”
The name was unfamiliar to Kamery. Neither had he mentioned Shaw or SI:7, so she phrased her response blandly. “What is the situation here?”
Gesturing to the ashy plains below, Helendis offered a brief summary. “As you may know, this area is rife with Blackrock Orcs. Their raiding parties from the mountain are increasing.” Kamery nodded; Shaw’s briefing, weeks ago, had indicated the growing unrest in the area.
Helendis’s brows furrowed. “We had always assumed that they were simply products of their savage upbringing.”
As Helendis spoke, Kamery glanced at Raynn, remembering the auburn-haired warrior’s intertwining history with the Orcs in the north. The Kaldorei warrior’s attention was primarily on his fellow Kaldorei, Elthas, and he didn’t notice Raynn stiffening at his words, her eyes growing stormy.
“Indeed, bloodlust and thirst for conflict empower them,” Helendis continued, before Raynn could speak, “but it is in fact the Black Dragonflight who control the Orcs of Blackrock and who fuel them with such rage and hostility.” His frown deepened. “Our previous Marshal was investigating the connection when he disappeared.” He paused to give them a moment to absorb the information.
At Helendis’s words, Raynn’s eyes unfocused with memory, and Elthas’s brows drew together. Kamery’s mind flashed back to their tales of the similarly aggressive fel-driven Orcs. But what did the Black Dragonflight have to do with Orcs? Shaw had mentioned the Orcs, Dark Iron Dwarves, and Fire Elementals—but not dragons. Did he not know? Is this new information?
Another memory arose, of the firemane drake, a lesser member of the Black Dragonflight, on Alcaz Island in Theramore. Is there a connection here, a continent away? How? The Bronze Dragonflight protects the time-ways; what drives the Black Dragonflight? Kamery could see her confusion mirrored in Carolyn’s identical grey eyes.
As usual, it was Bryna who seemed to adjust to the new information first. “What can we do to help?”
Helendis chuckled briefly, although there was little humor in the sound. “We need assistance from the armies of Stormwind.” He handed Bryna a sealed letter, directing her, “Deliver this request to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire.”
Indignation rushed through Kamery, although she carefully kept her face impassive. After all they had been through, all the training—surely Shaw hadn’t sent them here just to run messages? She could see her feelings echoed on Raynn and Carolyn’s faces.
Bryna took the request in stride though, and accepted the missive.
Helendis looked them over a bit more closely then, seeming to notice for the first time Raynn’s battle-worn but well-made armor, Carolyn’s highly enchanted robes, Elthas’s druidic tattoos, and Kamery’s wicked daggers. He blinked. “Perhaps you could also help clear out some of the dragon-kin below?”</Text>

            <Notes>Helendis’s exposition is way to abrupt. Kamery should be trying to find out why they’re there - but of course, she doesn’t know who knows what, so doesn’t want to reveal that Shaw sent them there specifically.</Notes>

            <Text>The sound of Raynn’s boots rang out on the polished marble floor of Stormwind Keep. The keep was even more imposing than the rest of the gleaming, white stone city, which had unsettled her so much on her first arrival four years ago that she hadn’t stayed long.
She had come to learn about the city’s history and inhabitants, on the advice of the two people who had mattered most to her. However, overwhelmed by the unfamiliarity, she had almost immediately escaped on the easy flight north to Ironforge; she had known of the extensive and well-maintained library in the Dwarven city, and her father had always spoken almost reverently about the blacksmiths there.
Even since returning to Stormwind a year ago, she often sought solace both in the smoky comfort of Stormwind’s Dwarven district, and in the convenient escape provided by the new Deeprun Tram, connecting the two cities with Gnomish ingenuity.
Refocusing on her current surroundings, Raynn wondered if it had all been worth it. The white stone wasn’t local; she knew that from her forays into the surrounding hills, searching for mineral outcroppings. She knew that it had been a statement, a testament to Human tenacity, after the original city had been razed in the wars decades ago.
The rebuilt city was a gleaming symbol of the resilience of Humans. She wondered if the people of Westfall cared about symbols though, after their lands had been ransacked by the disgruntled Stonemasons, operating as the criminal Defias Brotherhood.
Raynn shook her head, her ponytail swaying. How had she allowed Kamery to draw her so far into this political intrigue? Foremost, of course, the Defias had needed stopping; they had been plotting to destroy the city. Furthermore, she had enjoyed the easy camaraderie of the group, as each had settled into their own role. Fighting together as they had cleared out the Defias hideout had been invigorating. True to their name, the Defias fought fiercely, even to the death, for their cause.
Two guards in gleaming armor trimmed in blue enamel stood on either side of the entrance to the throne room. They watched her impassively as she entered. The vast, octagonal room was nearly empty, with guards stationed at regular intervals around the perimeter. Murmurs of gossip and whiffs of perfume—not unpleasant, but exotic to Raynn’s senses—drifted around the room from the handful of nobles standing by the walls. Banners in royal blue draped the white stone above their heads, blocking drafts and muffling sounds. Magni’s parting words echoed in her head, as the Dwarven King had bid her farewell. “Tread carefully, lass. The King is a good man, aye, but the nobles, they’re not what you’re used to.”
On a low dais in the middle of the room stood three people: on the right, a stern paladin in heavy, dark armor; on the left, a beautiful, dark-haired woman, her lips curled in a seemingly permanent look of disdain; in between them stood a boy of about ten, a crown on his blond head. Behind them, the throne stood at the back of the room, ornate and heavy, white marble gilded in gold. It was a stark contrast to the solid granite seat that Magni had sat on. As she approached, Raynn tried to reconcile this sight with what Magni had told her about the King of Stormwind.
The boy inclined his head slightly, his voice carrying a polite courtesy that belied his young age. “Greetings, warrior. I am King”—he stumbled slightly on the word—“Anduin Wrynn. What may we do for you today?” Anduin. Raynn had read about Varian’s young son, his mother killed when he was only a baby. She wondered what had happened to his father, but keeping Magni’s warning in mind, she said nothing.
“Bolvar Fordragon, Regent Lord of Stormwind.” The paladin introduced himself, his voice deep and smooth. With a gesture past the king’s head, he continued, “Lady Katrana Prestor, advisor to the King.”
Prestor looked at Raynn with clear condescension. Her eyes caught sight of the papers Raynn carried. “You have a missive for us?” She reached out her hand. Unable to politely decline, Raynn handed her the letter. Prestor slipped it in her pocket without a glance.
“A report on the Defias uprising,” Raynn explained. Remembering Shaw and Trias’s warnings, she tried to choose her words more carefully than usual. “Their influence has spread even within the city.”
Prestor waved a hand dismissively, and Fordragon stood unmoving. “Common rabble. They will be dealt with,” the noblewoman scoffed.
The Lady’s attitude grated on Raynn, and she had to remind herself of Magni’s warning once more. She sensed the young king’s attention on her still though. Kneeling to look him in the eye, she addressed her next words directly to him. “Threats have recently been countered within the keep itself.”
The young king’s eyes widened, emotions flickering through the blue depths. Gratitude seemed foremost, as he suddenly, impulsively, pulled a ring from the little finger of his left hand. The gold and sapphire signet was too big for him, and it came off easily. He held it out to Raynn. “I appreciate what you have done. Take this, as a token of my gratitude.”
Surprised, Raynn accepted the heavy ring from Anduin. Magni had called Varian a good man, and it seemed the king had raised his son to be the same. Perceptive also, as he seemed to understand that her role had been more than a simple messenger.
The moment was broken when Lady Prestor put her hand on Anduin’s shoulder. The young king stiffened slightly. The noblewoman cleared her throat impatiently, but it was Bolvar who spoke, his words carrying the weight of authority. “You have delivered your message. Return to your master.”
With a final nod of respect to Anduin, Raynn stood and turned to leave. Yes, she would indeed return to her master—not Shaw, with his unnervingly penetrating gaze—but to Dane Lindgren at the forge. She flexed her new plate gauntlets, eagerly wondering which piece the blacksmithing master would have her work on next. She had nearly completed the set that would prove her skill to the grand masters in Ironforge.</Text>

            <Title>Blood Oath - V2</Title>
            <Text>The air in the internment camp hung heavy with tension as the sun dipped low over the Arathi Highlands. Lysandra, Ellis, and Raynn approached the camp, a familiar routine tinged with apprehension. The camp sprawled before them, a collection of ramshackle tents and guarded fences, a temporary prison for the orcish captives.
As they entered, a distant rumble signaled the arrival of Thrall, Orgrim, Grom, and the orcish army. Dust stirred as they approached, a harbinger of the storm that was about to descend upon the camp.
At the entrance, Thrall's voice thundered, demanding the release of the orc prisoners. Fear gripped the humans within the camp, their anger building as they defiantly refused to let the orcs go. Among them, Lysandra and Ellis stepped forward, voices raised in favor of a peaceful resolution.
The mood soured swiftly. The camp's inhabitants, driven by fear and hatred, turned on Lysandra and Ellis. Fists and weapons found their mark, and the couple was beaten mercilessly. In the shadows, Raynn watched, the horror of the scene etching itself into her memory.
As the chaos unfolded, the orcish army, led by Grom and Thrall, stormed the camp. The clash of metal, the roars of orcs, and the screams of humans merged into a symphony of chaos. Near the end of the tumultuous battle, Grom, his massive figure cutting through the haze of conflict, discovered Lysandra unconscious and Ellis barely clinging to life.
Grom, a conflicted expression on his face, recognized the inevitability of their demise. In an act of mercy, he offered Ellis a swift death. Ellis, battered and broken, seized the moment to make a final plea. With sincerity etched in his weakening voice, he extracted a promise from Grom to find and protect Raynn.
Unknown to them, Raynn had been a hidden witness to the unfolding tragedy. Grom, now bound by an unspoken blood oath, fulfilled his promise, ending the lives of Ellis and Lysandra.
As the echoes of the battle subsided, Thrall arrived, a witness to the aftermath. Grom, grim-faced, informed Thrall of the need to find a human girl. An argument ensued, Grom invoking a blood oath that Thrall contested.
In a moment of tense compromise, Raynn stepped forward, proposing that they could leave her with the dwarves at Dun Modr, not far away. Grom, sensing a solution that would honor his promise and protect Raynn, reluctantly agreed.
Together, Grom, Thrall, and Raynn rode to the Thandol Span, leaving behind the scene of both tragedy and compromise. Behind them, the orc army, under Ogrim Doomhammer, prepared for the next internment camp.
As Grom and Thrall watched Raynn cross the span, a new chapter began for the young human, accepted by the dwarves of Dun Modr. Grom and Thrall, bound by duty and the consequences of their choices, rejoined the orc army, leaving behind the scars of the internment camp and carrying the weight of promises made and broken.</Text>

            <Title>Invitation to a Riot</Title>
            <Text>Carolyn watched the conflicting emotions flicker through the warrior’s eyes. Recognition first, of course, followed by a mixture of curiosity, suspicion, and, she thought, hopefully, pleasure. That last, she knew, was why she had been chosen for this task. Although she knew that her penchant for joining the melee irked Raynn, they had developed an understanding during their previous adventure. The bond between warrior and healer was strong.
She smiled, remembering that bond, as Raynn approached across the soot-streaked red brick plaza. The warrior’s hands flexed several times as she walked, and Carolyn realized that she was wearing new gauntlets. The grey metal still carried a fresh shine, unmarked by the scratches and smudges that combat added. A faint shimmer of magic surrounded them. Her smile broadened, recognizing the artistry. “You finished them! They’re amazing!”
Raynn relaxed, grinning in satisfaction. She looked down at her hands admiringly. “Gauntlets are so tricky!” The warrior exclaimed, but despite the complaint, her voice was filled with pride. She looked back up at Carolyn. “You didn’t just come here just to admire my work.”
The statement was a clear question, and Carolyn answered readily, “No, we’ve run into another situation. The Defias threat isn’t quite as finished as we thought.”
“Oh?” Raynn’s eyebrow raised in surprise. “VanCleef is gone. Their dreadnought is destroyed. Shouldn’t they have dispersed?”
Carolyn shook her head, feeling a strand of blonde hair loosen from its knot. She reached up to tuck the stray lock back in as she answered, “Kamery found a recently-written letter on VanCleef, addressed to Baros Alexston. The chief architect of Stormwind,” she added for clarity, although Raynn nodded impatiently. Carolyn continued, “We took the letter to Alexston. Apparently VanCleef wasn’t just bluffing; he still had contacts within the city. Shaw wants us to investigate VanCleef’s associates in the Stockades, but the prisoners are rioting.”
Raynn’s expression hardened, becoming unreadable. “SI:7 can’t handle it?” Her voice was equally expressionless. Carolyn winced, trying to keep her expression serene. She wished she had Kamery’s knack for that, or at least her bandanna - is that all it takes?
The warrior seemed to relax at her reaction though, asking, “How bad is the riot?”
Carolyn frowned, remembering their recent trip to the guard post at the prison’s entrance, and the less-than-welcoming Warden. While Kamery had tried to sweet talk the man, Carolyn had used her Shadow magic to see through the prisoners’ eyes. The mind vision spell was one of her favorite Shadow spells, since it was so benign, as well as being useful. Even Elthas, usually enthusiastic about employing his feline abilities, had quailed at the thought of trying to sneak through the mayhem of the Stockades.
“It was chaos. We can’t handle it alone,” she admitted.
“Not even with your staff?” Raynn chuckled, and Carolyn felt herself relax. The warrior seemed to be adjusting to the idea, her sense of justice overriding her discomfort concerning Shaw and Kamery.
Carolyn laughed. “No! I told you, I know what I’m doing.” She paused, then added, “When in doubt, find a valiant warrior!”
Raynn smirked, straightening with pride. “Alright. Is everyone else there?” With a gesture, she indicated that they should start walking.
Carolyn knew the warrior was referring to their group of five, and shook her head as she tried to keep up with the warrior’s decisive stride. “Bryna’s gone to visit her parents.” She considered, as they left the ever-present haze of the Dwarven District for the fresher air of the canal-side. “Although, I suppose we could go ask her too.”
Raynn’s firm nod evinced her sentiment. “She can help control the crowd. And she can handle herself well in a fight. Did you see her after that door blew up?”
Carolyn nodded, remembering, as they crossed one of the many bridges that connected the various districts of the city across the canals. She had been distracted by Kamery’s injury at first, but when she had looked up, it had become apparent that the mage had singlehandedly saved them from an ambush, taking down one of the Defias pirates on her own. Thinking back, she mused, “I can see why Elthas invited her.”
“Elthas?” Raynn sounded surprised, and Carolyn realized that the warrior had arrived in Sentinel Hill late, and had missed the initial introductions, wherein she had explained to Kamery why a request for a sister had brought three people instead. In turn, Kamery had admitted that she hadn’t known where Carolyn had been—she had penned the letter, but Shaw had taken it unaddressed, saying only that he would see that it got where it needed to go.
Weaving through the ever-present crowd of the Trade District, Carolyn nodded, explaining, “I left him to find us a portal from Darnassus to Stormwind. He found Bryna; found her fascinating, actually. As she cast the portal, he invited her along!” Her voice bubbled with laughter at the memory.
“He’s got good instincts then.” Raynn sounded approving. Carolyn wondered if she realized just how much Elthas was ruled by his instincts sometimes. As they crossed the last bridge and entered the district where Bryna’s parents’ shop was located, Carolyn suspected the tightly controlled warrior had no idea.
Carolyn followed Raynn into the twisting maze of the Mage Quarter. She had only been here once before, briefly, as she and Elthas had followed Bryna from the Tower when they had first arrived in Stormwind. The seemingly random jumble of buildings still intimidated her, as she had heard rumors of unwitting travelers being lost for days in the narrow, twisting alleyways. At least it was pleasant, she thought, feeling smooth grass under her feet, a welcome contrast to the white cobblestones of the rest of the city.
They didn’t have far to go, it turned out. Bryna was sitting on a low stone wall just to the left of the entrance, reading a book. The mage looked up as they approached, and before either of them even spoke, she had snapped her book closed and was standing to join them. “What are we blowing up next?” Her dark eyes sparkled with anticipation.</Text>

            <Text>As Gideon and Evelyn immersed themselves in the intricate dance of gears and gadgets, Anduin Wrynn found a moment of respite in the workshop's bustling atmosphere. Lily, standing beside him, observed the duo with a mixture of fascination and curiosity.

&quot;It's quite a place, isn't it?&quot; Lily remarked, her eyes tracing the intricate details of the inventions scattered around the workshop.

Anduin nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. &quot;Indeed. Gideon is a master of his craft, and Evelyn seems to share his passion for invention.&quot;

Lily chuckled, her gaze briefly meeting Anduin's. &quot;Looks like you've found some kindred spirits in this strange world.&quot;

Anduin's thoughts drifted to the challenges they faced, the weight of responsibility that always rested on his shoulders. &quot;It's a welcome distraction,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Sometimes, the complexity of machinery is simpler than the intricacies of diplomacy.&quot;

Lily placed a reassuring hand on his arm. &quot;You can't carry the world alone, Anduin. We're here with you, navigating these uncharted waters together.&quot;

Anduin's gaze lingered on the makeshift assembly of devices, a silent acknowledgment of the shared burdens and unexpected alliances forged in the crucible of uncertainty. In that moment, the workshop became more than a haven of invention; it symbolized the resilience of camaraderie amid the chaos of disparate worlds colliding.

As Gideon and Evelyn continued their collaborative dance of invention, Anduin and Lily found solace in the present moment, embracing the camaraderie that bloomed amidst the whirring machinery and the promise of a repaired portal. The weight of the unknown future momentarily lifted, replaced by the comforting hum of gears in motion and the companionship of newfound allies.</Text>

            <Title>31-09-L100-Sparring in Lunarfall</Title>
            <Text>The sun dipped low over Raynn's Garrison, casting long shadows across the training grounds. The clang of steel echoed as Raynn sparred with her iconic weapon, Shadowmourne, its dark aura adding an ominous touch to the dance of blades. Varian Wrynn stood at the edge of the training area, watching with a keen eye.

Varian: Impressive as always, Raynn. That weapon of yours is a sight to behold.

Raynn, catching her breath, offered a nod of acknowledgment.

Raynn: Thank you, Your Majesty. Shadowmourne has served me well.

Varian: (smirking) Don't go easy on me now. I didn't come all this way for a leisurely stroll.

Raynn grinned, the dark runes on Shadowmourne reflecting the dimming sunlight. She prepared for another round, the air charged with anticipation.

Varian: I've been thinking, Raynn. About Anduin.

Raynn, focused but attentive, arched an eyebrow.

Raynn: What about him, Your Majesty?

Varian: (parrying a strike) He's a pacifist in a world that seems to revel in conflict. Sometimes, I can't help but worry.

Raynn: (lunging) Anduin's strength lies in his convictions, not in a sword. He believes in a better way, even when the world disagrees.

Varian: (blocking) A better way, yes. But I can't help but wonder if he'll face a world that refuses to see reason.

Raynn: (sidestepping) Anduin's strength isn't just in his beliefs; it's in his ability to inspire change. You've seen it, Your Majesty. He's not afraid to challenge the status quo.

Varian: (counter-attacking) True, but this world can be unforgiving. I worry about him facing the harsh realities that we, as warriors, understand all too well.

Raynn: (parrying) Anduin has allies. He has you, and he has the Alliance. We'll stand by him.

Their blades locked for a moment, both warriors catching their breath.

Varian: You're right, Raynn. He's not alone. And he has warriors like you to look up to.

Raynn: (smiling) And you, Your Majesty. We all play our part.

Varian acknowledged the sentiment with a nod, a silent understanding passing between them. The sun dipped lower, casting a warm glow over the Garrison, as Raynn and Varian resumed their sparring — a dance of blades that mirrored the complexities of the world they sought to protect.


With growing sexual attraction:
The Garrison at Lunarfall stood as a bastion against the challenges of Draenor, its walls echoing with the sounds of training and camaraderie. In the midst of this fortified haven, Varian Wrynn found himself drawn to the training grounds where Raynn, the valiant warrior from Stormwind, honed her skills.

The sparring sessions had become a routine, an opportunity for both to refine their combat prowess. The air was charged with the energy of clashes between steel, the sound of blades meeting in a rhythmic dance. Varian, observing Raynn's precise movements, couldn't help but admire the grace with which she wielded her weapons.

As the sun dipped below the Draenor horizon, casting an amber glow upon the Garrison, Varian stepped forward to engage Raynn in a sparring match. Their blades clashed, each strike resonating with a distinct melody of combat. Varian's gaze locked onto Raynn's eyes, a silent acknowledgment of the unspoken connection that had grown between them.

With each exchange, the tension heightened, and the atmosphere shifted. The sparring evolved into a dance, bodies moving in sync, and the line between combat and something more elusive began to blur. Varian's movements became deliberate, charged with an intensity that transcended the confines of the training grounds.

Raynn, sensing the shift, met Varian's gaze with a mixture of determination and something deeper. The sparring became an intricate dance of mutual understanding, and beneath the layers of armor and blades, an unspoken attraction simmered.

Varian, fueled by a growing desire, allowed himself to be ensnared in the ebb and flow of the dance. Their blades moved with a shared rhythm, and in the intensity of the moment, the Garrison walls seemed to fade away, leaving only the connection between Varian and Raynn.

As the sparring session reached its zenith, their movements became more fluid, more intimate. The clang of steel on steel echoed the unspoken tension that lingered in the air. Varian, a monarch on the battlefield, found himself captivated by a different kind of conquest—one that unfolded in the quiet intimacy of Lunarfall's training grounds.

            <Text>Elthas sneezed. He shook his head to clear it. The path, winding through fresh, evergreen-scented hills, had led into a tunnel filled with pale blue mist. Raynn and Bryna had led the way confidently—and the mage had done this before—so he had followed readily. The mist had smelled pleasantly spicy, but it had tickled his nose. A strange swirl of magic had enveloped them, tingling against the runes on his shoulders, and then scene had changed. The sensations had been similar to portal travel, and yet, completely different.
The evergreen scents returned, although muted and mixed with earthy smells from the small cave they now found themselves in. The grassy hills lay just outside. Elthas longed to explore, to bound across the thick, verdant slopes.
Pulling his thoughts back into the cave, the druid reminded himself that they were here for a mission. His attention focused on the others in the cave. He could see that the Humans from Stormwind were still confused, and wondered how much they knew of the history of Kalimdor. Of all of Azeroth, really, he realized.
Raynn had seemed more familiar, reminding Elthas of his first impressions of the warrior and how she had reminded him of Kalimdor. It had been at Mount Hyjal, in Kalimdor, that Thrall, and the Horde, had been instrumental in defeating Archimonde and turning back the invasion of the Burning Legion. Their mission here was clear; if Thrall hadn’t led the Horde to Kalimdor, then Archimonde and his Legion would have destroyed the World Tree before the druids could mount their counterattack.
“Greetings,” a bronze dragon ducked his head into the small cave. “I am Erozion. Here, the Infinite flight has kidnapped Taretha Foxton, daughter of the secretary of Aedelas Blackmoore, ruler of Durnholde and overseer of all internment camps on Azeroth.”
At Erozion’s mention of Blackmoore’s name, Raynn’s hands tightened into fists. This was personal for her, Elthas realized.
“It was Taretha who created the original diversion at Durnholde, allowing Thrall to escape,” Erozion continued. “Now the Infinite have captured Taretha. The diversion will not happen without your involvement. You must use these incendiary devices to burn down the internment lodges.”
Raynn took the proffered sack immediately. Her step was firm and determined as she led the way out of the cave.</Text>

            <Title>Taretha</Title>
            <Text>Carolyn watched the green-skinned Orc as he followed Raynn out of the keep. He was almost as tall as a Kaldorei, but much broader. The ragged vest and leggings he was wearing stretched over powerful muscles. His dark hair was long, braided down his back, with two narrower braids framing his broad, tusked face.
She didn’t know much about him, only that he had escaped internment somehow—well, now I know how—and then traveled with his people across the ocean to Kalimdor, rising to become the Warchief of the Horde. Savage, brute, charismatic, powerful, wise, were all terms that she had heard used to describe the Orc.
As they passed the armory, Thrall paused, then entered the small room. A quick blow from his massive arm sent the armorer to the ground, unconscious, and the Orc selected a weapon and light armor from the shelves. Carolyn shivered at the raw strength behind that blow, but having seen the conditions the Orc had been forced to endure, she understood.
Jaina had known Thrall better, Carolyn realized, and she had trusted the Orc. Otherwise the arch-mage wouldn’t have tried to arrange a peace talk with King Varian Wrynn.
There were few guards remaining to stop them as they made their way across the bailey and back out of the main gates. The ones that tried were quickly dispatched by Raynn and Thrall. They fought well together, Carolyn noticed, their movements complementing each other as they stood shoulder to shoulder.
The warrior had been true to her word, and had progressed carefully through the entire incident, but Carolyn could still feel her roiling emotions. Towards the Orcs, Raynn had been sympathetic and kind, but she had dispatched the Humans opposing them with a bitter anger that chilled Carolyn.
Reaching the roadway outside the Keep, Kamery turned to Thrall. For all that Raynn had easily led them and spoken to the other Orcs in the camp, the warrior had seemed a bit at a loss with Thrall himself.
“You’re free now,” the rogue told the future Warchief. “Go and find safety in the mountains.”
Thrall was stubborn though. “Where is Taretha. I would thank her in person.”
Kamery shook her head. “I’m afraid the situation is a bit more complicated than that. We will take care of Taretha.”
“I am no coward. I will not run and hide while Taretha is in danger.” Thrall was very stubborn; Carolyn felt a sense of kinship, and admiration for his selflessness.
She hadn’t even noticed Raynn leave during the conversation, but now the warrior returned, leading a horse from the Keep’s stables. She handed the reins to Thrall, saying, “It’s no wolf, but it will have to do.”
Even Thrall seemed confused by the statement, but he mounted the horse awkwardly and spurred it down the road after Raynn.</Text>

            <Text>In the small study room, Elthas stepped protectively in front of his new young friend as the door crashed inwards. Across the room, Broll instantly dropped into bear form as Kamery spun, her daggers in hand. A black dragonspawn burst into the room.
After Kamery had returned to the study, Elthas and Anduin’s rambunctious play had settled, and they had been speaking quietly, safely at the far end of the room. Ever since they had arrived, the young Prince had been asking questions about his druidic abilities; the boy reminded Elthas of Carolyn when they had first met. The looming dragonspawn now put their relative safety into question.
Broll growled, rearing up and swiping both massive claws across the dragonspawn’s exposed side. It turned to him immediately, and Kamery’s daggers found their marks on its flank, slicing open tendons in one leg, eliciting a harsh, angry hiss from her enemy.
Although the dragonspawn stumbled briefly, it still had three legs. Kamery’s attacks barely broke its concentration as it conjured a fireball to fling at Broll. The druid dodged agilely, although the scent of singed fur filling the room told Elthas that he hadn’t been completely unscathed. Broll roared and bashed the dragonspawn with a solid backhand swipe.
The fireball ignited a bookshelf at the back of the room, adding the smoke and scent of burning paper and leather to the air. With a quick word to his young charge, Elthas shepherded the young Prince towards the door, trying to avoid the dragonspawn’s notice. As they approached, he could sense Kamery’s poisons working on her foe, as her daggers once more found their marks in the humanoid torso, where it joined to the draconic hind end.
As he and Anduin neared her, Elthas briefly shifted out of feline form. Drawing on his connection to nature, he cast a slow-acting healing spell on Broll, then he bent to the Prince. “Stay low,” he instructed, shifting immediately back to feline form to join Kamery’s attack.
Although the dragonspawn fell under their combined attack, the back of the room was now ablaze. They would have to seek safety elsewhere. Leaving the study, they paused in the hallway to assess their options. To their left, several palace guards were engaged with another dragonspawn, with two more bearing down on them.
The way to the right was clear, and Kamery suggested that the courtyard and library might be safe, so they turned in that direction. Broll led the way, remaining in ursine form, while Elthas paced beside the young Prince, staying visible to reassure the boy. Although Anduin’s face was pale and his eyes wide, he seemed calm and composed.
That composure shattered however, when they passed the entrance to the throne room. The sounds of battle from within drew their attention, and Anduin caught sight of the two Varians facing one another on the far side of the dais, their voices raised in angry censure of one another.
Ignoring the massive dragon in the way, the boy dashed determinedly across the throne room before either of the druids or Kamery could react. With the dragonspawn alerted to their presence, the three were drawn into the melee, even as Anduin confronted the arguing Kings.
“Stop it!” the Prince cried, the intensity in his young voice cutting through the clamor of the battle. He stopped at the center of the dais, between his fathers and the startled black dragon, a small, innocent figure in the midst of the chaos. Onyxia’s head turned to regard him with surprise that quickly turned to malevolent intent.</Text>

            <Text>Aliandra:
I think I'm starting to base her on a previous character I had who went from light and innocent to darkness.. Caro comes out the other side more balanced though.
	Lacy, delicate, blonde.
	A fairy, pixie, nymph.
	Wide-eyed innocence,
	Blue-eyed wonder.

	Secrets lurk beneath the surface,
	Like fish in a calm pond.
	Watching, waiting,
	To be discovered, uncovered.

I raise my hand, utter the magical phrase, and the power flows through me, gathering in my upraised hand, before lashing out to strike my enemies. A moment later, another invocation, another gathering of power, although more subtle this time, and my foes yelp in pain, as the Shadow flays their minds. I throw my head back and laugh, reveling in the power which flows around and through me. I can rend flesh, and tear bones. I can bring disease and drain others of their power. I can also heal, protect, and restore. The choice is mine. The power is mine to command.
	Tendrils of darkness writhe as things alive, as they work their way up my arm from my dagger hand (Xal’atath). I watch them in a somewhat detached fascination. I know what brought this on, but I do not move to stop it. I welcome it rather, seeing the darkness work its way towards my heart as though it were happening to another. I feel detached from life. So much of the joy is gone. I am surrounded by shadows, ghosts from the past haunting me (Varian?), demanding that I avenge their deaths, and yet, I feel so helpless to do so, despite my not inconsiderable power.

            <Title>The King</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Entering Molten Core with &quot;the armies of Stormwind&quot;
- Carolyn observes Varian</Synopsis>
            <Text>Six months later, as he had once promised, King Varian Wrynn of Stormwind led the gathered forces of the Alliance into the Molten Core to confront Ragnaros, the Elemental Lord.
Watching the King as they approached the shimmering entrance to Ragnaros’s abode, Carolyn couldn’t help but compare him to the rough warrior she had struggled to heal on their previous visit to these magma-lit tunnels. Although Varian had been forceful and commanding then, he had been so rough and impatient that it had been easy to see him as a man, rather than royalty.
The man leading them now though, was undeniably a King. Although he still eschewed a shield, in favor of a two-handed sword, his body was now covered by full plate armor of gold-trimmed steel, adorned with the lion of Stormwind. His dark hair was still roughly tied back, and his stern face still scarred, but those details were overshadowed by his presence.
He led the assembled forces with regal aplomb, consulting his tacticians, then decisively directing their movements. Over the past months, the King had dedicated himself to undoing the damage wrought by Onyxia and the Black Dragonflight, and Stormwind thrived. Through Kamery, Carolyn knew that the King had enlisted Shaw’s aid in combating the corruption in the House of Nobles.
The spy-master was with them now, though, accompanied by some of his agents. Several of them had just returned from scouting the upper reaches of the Core, and they were reporting their findings to the leaders of the assault force. As they finished, the King looked up; as his eyes met hers, he offered a familiar smile. The moment was fleeting, as he had an army to mobilize, but it warmed Carolyn’s heart.</Text>

            <Text>37: The Generals
Varian also seemed to be dealing most of his damage to that one, although his wild blows struck all three of their foes. Once again, his fighting style reminded her of Grom Hellscream. She wondered what the Human king would think of the comparison.
41: Homecoming
Looking around the plain homestead, Raynn felt a sense of solidarity with Kamery and Carolyn. Her own upbringing had been similar— simple but loving, yet ended with tragedy.
43: The Prince and the King
Launching herself forward, Raynn caught hold of the Prince, pulling him protectively close as her momentum carried them into a roll past the two Kings. She rose to one knee, Anduin finding his feet in front of her, as they watched as Onyxia’s spell enveloped both Varians in shadow.
“No,” Anduin’s voice broke as he reached out, but Raynn held him firmly. Whatever was happening to his fathers, it would do him no good to be caught in it himself. A brief flash of memory struck her, of being in the same situation herself, watching from concealment as her parents died. She bowed her head, resting her cheek on the boy’s blond hair in commiseration as he sagged in her arms.
47: The Upper Spire
“Rend Blackhand,” she spat, and was rewarded by a snarl of acknowledgment. Raynn remembered standing on a low hill in Durotar, looking at the newly-build Orcish city.
“Orgrimmar,” Thrall told her it was called; named for the former Warchief of the Horde whose armor and weapon Thrall now wore. He told her of Orgrim Doomhammer, who had wrested control of the Horde from Blackhand and the Shadow Council, regaining their honor. Although Orgrim had fallen during the liberation of the Horde in the Arathi Highlands, not far from where Raynn’s own parents had died, his legacy lived on within Thrall, the new Warchief.
Smirking at the Orc before her, she switched to Rend’s own language. “False Warchief,” she taunted in Orcish. “Son of a tyrant.”
She was getting his attention now. She smiled grimly as she parried a furious swing of his polearm. Feeling Carolyn’s healing warmth spread through her body, she focused on keeping Rend’s attention. “Ur’gora.”
Rend became reckless in his fury at the insult, his blade swinging wildly. Behind him, Kamery dodged the flurry, then resumed her attacks. Elthas was less nimble, and hissed in pain as his left ear was lopped off. Holy light glowed over the wound moments later. No longer set on her heels, Carolyn had stepped to one side and was whispering healing spells once more.
Rend’s wild attack had left him out of position. Seeing her opportunity, Raynn thrust forward with her sword, driving it into his abdomen, exposed by his traditional war harness. With a grunt, he fell to his knees. His single red eye was fixed on her now, still glowing with hatred.
Pulling her sword free, Raynn stared into his scarred, hatred-twisted face. “Lok-tar ogar,” she whispered. His eye closed, and he fell.
Raynn stood a moment longer, then dropped to her knees. Her head fell back, eyes closing, as emotions roiled through her. Although he was far from the first Orc they had fought, something had been different, facing the erstwhile Chieftain’s heir.
She could feel her friends gathering around her in silent camaraderie. Opening her eyes, she saw Vaelastrasz was looking from one end of the room to the other, frowning at the closed gates in either direction.
Looking up at the spectators on the balcony above, she saw shock in their eyes, but also respect. One, who seemed to be their leader, inclined his head slightly. He gestured to another with one hand, his eyes not leaving Raynn.
A moment later, the gate that they had entered from rattled open. Raynn nodded in return to the Orc. They had won the right to face the black dragon champion.
48: Onyxia’s Lair
Raynn felt her resolve slipping away in the face of the onslaught, struggling to maintain her grip, to shield her friends and allies.
&quot;You must face the fury within you, Raynn. Embrace the power that courses through your veins.” The words resounded in her mind suddenly, a long-forgotten echo from a tormented mentor. The memory of the wild blows, barely controlled, rose up in her. There was power there - a different kind of power than the carefully controlled defensive style that she had honed over the past years.
Raynn’s shield dropped from its protective position as she took a more aggressive stance. The fear still echoed through her mind, but she embraced it. Drawing strength from it, she allowed it to boil up and out of her in an inarticulate roar of rage.
Her voice broke through her allies’ paralysis, spurring them to action.
…
Grimacing from the pain the dragon’s razor-sharp claws were inflicting, Raynn swung her sword with all her strength and rage. Her parents, slain by their own kind, fueled by fear and hatred. Grommash, tormented by demons until his moment of death. Even Thrall, his memories of their battles erased by indifferent bronze dragons.
Onyxia fell, her eyes losing the burning light. Raynn stood still for a moment, catching her breath, and gathering her thoughts. All of her losses, all of her anger, faded back away again, swept away under the friendship and camaraderie she shared with the jubilant group that now surrounded her. The feelings lingered, to be sure, but now under control. She knew she could harness them again, learn to master and use them, just as Grom had once instructed.</Text>

            <Title>Back in Lakeshire</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bryna returns to Elthas and updates Elthas</Synopsis>
            <Text>By the time she reached Lakeshire, the cool winds and lush landscapes of the flight had soothed Bryna’s frayed nerves and she was back to her calm self. The gryphon perch was across the long, narrow lake from the town itself. Although she usually preferred the bustle of Stormwind, Bryna took a moment to bask in the calmness of the picturesque hamlet nestled among trees and low hills, knowing that they would soon be returning to the ashy wasteland to the north.
As she crossed the wide white stone bridge that spanned the width of the lake, Bryna spotted a playful sea lion frolicking in the waters, and turned at the end of the bridge to approach the shoreline. The long afternoon shadows in the shelter of the bridge pilings gave her an opportunity to shed her disguise, and she happily did so, placing the red hat firmly back on her head.
Elthas caught sight of the distinct object, and emerged from the water, smoothly shifting out of his aquatic form to wade to shore. “How did it go?” the druid asked. “You weren’t noticed?”
Bryna shook her head, annoyance resurfacing. “They looked right over me.” She sighed in exasperation. “They deputized me!” Turning, she began walking to the town hall. She would have to tell Solomon that his reinforcements weren’t coming anytime soon.
Elthas’s eyebrows rose as he walked with her. “We’re tasked with defending Lakeshire ourselves? Just the five of us?”
With a snort, Bryna elaborated, “They didn’t even know about the four of you. They sent me back to investigate. They want more proof.”
Elthas shook his head, his long hair swaying. “It doesn’t sound like they want anything. But perhaps we can find something. They didn’t know about us after all.”
Smiling at his optimism, Bryna agreed, entering the town hall. Solomon, understandably, didn’t share the druid’s cheerful outlook. In fact, Bryna thought the man might break down and cry as she delivered the news. Morosely, he directed them to return to the Burning Steppes and report to Marshal Maxwell, as his new deputies.</Text>

            <Notes>- Bryna’s got all the pieces now: she knows Dragons can manipulate memories; she knows Dragons can take mortal visages
- Doesn’t she suspect anything in Stormwind?
- Is Onyxia using some sort of magic to muddle Bryna’s mind too? Why is she so unpleasant to adventurers anyway? She uses charm on others. Is it because they’re female? Or not noble? What is her logic here? Condescension for all mortals, but Varian and Bolvar are useful - adventurers are not.</Notes>

            <Title>Maps and Ships</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Raynn studies the map of Kalimdor at the inn in Booty Bay
- Raynn remembers her goodbye with Thrall and Jaina
- Raynn decides to travel from Booty Bay to Ratchet rather than Steamwheedle, to visit Jaina along the way</Synopsis>
            <Text>Sitting on the edge of her narrow bed in the Booty Bay Inn, Raynn stared at the large map mounted on the wooden wall opposite her. Built from the hull of a ship, raised above the docks outside, this end of the inn creaked and swayed with the wind. The salty tang of sea air pervaded the cramped room, tucked in the bow of the vessel. The narrow space made the map easily viewable, and Raynn’s eyes wandered over the familiar reaches of Kalimdor.
The routes of the ships from Booty Bay were traced out in red, overlaying the standard map of Azeroth. The direct route, of course, would be the southern route—to Steamwheedle Port, on the eastern coastline of Tanaris, and then just a short trip along a well-traveled road through the desert to Gadgetzan.
Her eyes kept returning to the northern line though, as it traced the route to Ratchet, in the Barrens. She knew from experience that it was just a short trip down the coast from the Goblin town to Theramore. To Jaina Proudmoore. Her fingers twisted in the worn fabric of her bedding as her heart ached at the memory.
Raynn stood between Jaina and Thrall as the three looked down on the now-deserted Northwatch Hold. Admiral Proudmoore, Jaina’s father, had recently waged war on the Horde from that fortress, and others along the coast, including usurping Jaina’s own neutral town of Theramore.
Raynn, along with Theramore’s other inhabitants, had huddled on the upper floor of the inn, watching through the windows as the Horde entered the town and their leader, Rexxar, had entered Jaina’s tower, which hadn’t been Jaina’s at that time.
The Orcs had outmatched Proudmoore’s forces, and Jaina had ordered Theramore’s own guards to stand down. There was an uneasy truce in most parts of the town, with the exception of the tower. Eventually, Rexxar had emerged, victorious, and led his warriors away.
Jaina had emerged, and told them Theramore was safe once again; that they were once more at peace with the Horde. Relieved, the townspeople had resumed their lives.
But the incident had changed Jaina’s attitude towards Raynn. Now, she and Thrall were telling Raynn that she should travel to Stormwind, and find her heritage, among her father’s people.
Thrall laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. “There is value in knowing one’s past. Do not let your perceptions always be colored that day. Our paths will cross again; the bonds we’ve forged will endure.” His look included all three of them.
Jaina held out a circlet, intricately wrought of gold. With a smile, she explained, “I know you hate wearing a helmet in practice. Someday, you will find a real battle. This is enchanted; it will protect you as well as any helm.”
At Raynn’s doubtful look at the glinting metal, she added, “It will also be invisible when you wear it. But only then”—her eyes sparkled teasingly—“you wouldn’t want to forget where you left it now, would you?”
Glancing over at the circlet, now laying on the small table beside her bed, Raynn smiled at the memory, her eyes glistening. Jaina had always been perceptive and thoughtful.
She had been resentful then, feeling rejected by the two people she admired and trusted the most. Looking back now, she could admit that they had been right.
After Admiral Proudmoore’s death, Jaina had been cut off from her homeland entirely. She had been in command of a far-flung, unsupported outpost, with only the most tenuous of peace agreements with the Horde. Proudmoore had shown that it was only too easy for the old tensions to flare up again.
Thrall had likewise faced the same situation. Raynn had longed to join him in Orgrimmar, but there were too many in the Horde who held lingering resentment, or even hatred, towards Humans. She wouldn’t have been safe there, and she knew he had felt an obligation to protect her still.
No, it had been for her own safety, and her own growth, that they had sent her away. And she had taken their advice; both had suggested she learn about her father’s people, about the Humans of Stormwind, not Lordaeron, and she had. First, from the more comfortable libraries of the Dwarves, but then later in the libraries of Stormwind itself.
She had met good people in Stormwind too, she realized. Carolyn, the priestess with the warm smile and the penchant for melee. Elthas, the exuberant feline druid. Bryna, the quick-minded mage. Even Kamery, the too-curious rogue.
With a fond smile, Raynn made her decision. She would take the longer route, and she would go thank Jaina.</Text>

            <Title>Leather Interlude</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Elthas works on his &quot;secret&quot; leatherworking project</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Bryna disappeared from sight, engulfed in a swirl of teleportation magic, Elthas considered his options. Although the teleportation spell would bring her to Stormwind instantly, she would still have to make her way to the Keep, gain an audience with Fordragon, and then fly back to Lakeshire by gryphon. He decided that he had a few hours—enough time to continue work on his latest leather-working project.
Shifting into feline form, he padded out onto the boardwalk that ran between the waterfront and the main buildings of the town. The sun glinting off the water was enticing, and he hoped that he would have time to enjoy it later. He did enjoy the weightless freedom of the sleek sea lion.
First, though, he needed to find a quiet place to work. Several docks jutted out into the water, but they were bustling with activity, as fishermen hauled in their catches. Beyond the wide stone bridge that crossed the narrow lake, however, he spotted another dock. Hoping that it would be less-used, he loped easily along the shoreline. The dock was indeed deserted. After taking a moment to enjoy the view and the clean, fresh scent of the air, Elthas shifted out of form. Settling cross-legged on the smooth wood, he pulled out the pieces of leather, wax, and a soft cloth.
While in Un’goro Crater, he had collected, cured, and tanned quite a bit of leather from the local fauna, and he had cut pieces for two pairs of bracers. He had already tooled the intricate designs—imbued with enchantment, as well as decorative—and had dyed and burnished the leather. He now needed to seal the leather with wax, and then the bracers would be nearly completed.</Text>

            <Title>Profits in the Wetlands</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Kamery, Carolyn, Elthas, and Bryna have been adventuring through the Wetlands and are now crossing the Thandol Span
- Kamery picks Kingsblood; Bry recognizes its value
- Kamery is initially confused at the idea of selling herbs, but Bry promises it could actually pay for horses for her and Carolyn (Elthas has brought up the idea of the Humans getting horses)
</Synopsis>
            <Text>The stone arches of the Thandol Span rose up high overhead as Elthas padded slowly across the massive Dwarven bridge towards the Arathi Highlands to the north. The scent of the sea far below was faint in his nose, mingling with the lingering smells of mud and moss from the lands behind them. Ahead, greener plains promised fresher air, as they spread out beyond the far end of the bridge.
Although crumbling in places now, the Thandol Span remained strong and solid, an impressive testament to the masonry of the Dwarves. Traces of intricate carvings on the pillars, smoothed but not quite erased by time, were lingering reminders of their artistry.
A pair of Dwarves clattered past them riding south into the Wetlands on their sturdy rams. Elthas’s tail twitched briefly as he watched the long-furred beasts. Pushing aside thoughts of prey, he looked over at the Humans trudging along the side of the road beside him and an old thought resurfaced once more.
Shifting out of form to walk alongside them, he voiced that thought, “You need horses.”
His unexpected shift and statement caught the Humans by surprise and they took a moment to respond. Carolyn, as he had expected, wrinkled her nose in distaste at the idea of the typical Human mounts. Elthas caught her eye with an understanding smile; he knew she had a different type of mount in mind.
Bryna’s red hat was nodding acceptance of the idea, but Kamery raised the problem, “Horses are expensive.”
The red hat turned, as its wearer looked at Kamery with astonishment. “You’re carrying a small fortune in kingsblood in your herb bag. You could buy four horses with that!”
Kamery’s grey eyes widened as the statement stopped her in her tracks. “What do you mean?” she asked in confusion.
Bryna also stopped, to explain, “The trading houses, in all the cities. There’s a huge market for kingsblood these days.”
“Sell my herbs?” Kamery asked slowly, as she absorbed the idea, but Bryna nodded enthusiastically.
Carolyn looked thoughtful. “You do have an awful lot of it,” she observed, drawing amused smiles from Elthas and Bryna. Kamery’s frequent detours to pick herbs through the Wetland had been an endless distraction during their travels over the past few weeks.
“Will you have use for it all?” Elthas asked, genuinely curious. The rogue could make all manner of useful potions, but he had little understanding of what each was comprised of.
Kamery shook her head, her eyes brightening over her black bandanna as she adjusted to the idea of selling the herbs. “I don’t actually use kingsblood for that much,” she admitted.
“Then why have we been chasing it all over the Wetlands?” Carolyn asked, laughing. “And why is always surrounded by those horrible slimes?” Her face showed her distaste for the oozing semi-sentient creatures that were prevalent in the damp marshlands.
Shrugging, Kamery was at a loss to answer, but Bryna filled her silence. “For profit,” the mage declared with an emphatic nod.
Bemused, the others had no choice but to agree. Decision made, the mage began gathering the arcane energies for a portal. She was nothing if not efficient, Elthas decided, remembering her doing the same when he had asked for aid returning to Darnassus, before he had even had a chance to say goodbye to his friends.
This time, it was Carolyn who interrupted the spell-casting. “Let’s at least deliver this message to Refuge Point,” she suggested. “I don’t want to have to walk all this way again.”
The arcane energy faded as Bryna lowered her hands. “Alright, let’s go!” The thought of making money seemed to have energized her and she led the way swiftly across the bridge.</Text>

            <Text>Recovering herself, she bent over her moonsaber’s neck, encouraging the giant cat to follow the smaller one. Elthas had slowed as he approached the town gate, and they entered together. Carolyn saw Raynn now, at an outdoor forge in the open space beyond the smaller houses. The warrior was working on something, under the tutelage of a tall, muscular Kaldorei. 
The warrior had shed her usual full plate armor in the heat, and, like her tutor, was wearing just a breastplate and boots, with leather leggings. Unlike her tutor, whose long platinum hair flowed freely around his delicately pointed ears and halfway down his back, Raynn’s hair was sensibly tied up in her usual ponytail. Her bare arms glistened with sweat, as the muscles flexed to swing the heavy hammer again.
Waiting until the swing was complete, and Raynn had regrouped, Carolyn called out a greeting as she and Elthas approached. The warrior looked up, and delight lit her face. With a quick word to her instructor, who dismissed her with a wave, she jogged over to join them.
“What brings you here?” A pleased smile lit Raynn’s face, which was now tanned from time spent in the sun.
“We got lost.” Elthas shifted out of form to answer.
Carolyn laughed at his glum tone. “Don’t mind him. He was as delighted as I was to see a friendly face here.”
“Two, actually,” Raynn told them. She glanced around the town, but then shrugged. “Bryna is somewhere around here. My blacksmithing bores her.” Her tone was light, amused, and Carolyn saw the satisfaction that the warrior took in her work in her eyes.
“We should let you get back to it then.” She glanced at the waiting forge-master.
Raynn’s gaze followed hers, but the warrior shook her head, sending her ponytail swaying. “We usually break for the midday meal anyway. It gets too hot to work. Let’s get you settled and we can catch up over lunch.”
Carolyn nodded, and they followed Raynn to the inn across the small town. The buildings were sunk into the ground, she realized as they entered, which explained why they all seemed so low from the outside. Elthas still had to duck to enter, but once inside, he could stand straight.
They arranged a pair of rooms for the next few nights, and joined Raynn at a table at the back of the common room.
“Is Kamery with you?” the warrior asked. Carolyn wondered if she was worried or just curious. Raynn seemed more relaxed now, but the priestess couldn’t tell if it was her recent blacksmithing accomplishments, the new setting, or something else.
“No.” Elthas answered as Carolyn was still lost in thought. “Shaw asked her to return to Stormwind, for a solo mission.”
Raynn nodded, once again not showing the usual tension. “Lunch for three then. The chef here is one of the best. I like the Chimaerok Chops, but if you don’t like spice, then the Clamlette Surprise is excellent.” She waved to a white-hatted Goblin standing beside the hearth on the far side of the inn.
“Yeah, what’dya want?” He yelled across the mostly empty room.
Raynn glanced at her companions. Both shrugged, and Raynn yelled back, “Three Chops, please.”
The Goblin turned to busy himself at his workbench, and soon the scent of roasting meat drifted across to where they sat.
“What about Bryna?” Elthas asked, watching the Goblin chef with interest.
“She’s usually out all day,” Raynn shrugged. “She’s been exploring the desert. So far, she’s avoided falling for Trenton’s tales of enchanted swords in the Troll ruins, but with you here, she may try to drag you along.”
Once again, Carolyn found herself marveling at the warrior’s ease. Curious, she asked, “What have you been up to all this time? You can’t have been forging new armor the entire time?”
Raynn laughed, “Not the whole time. I finished my iron set, but it was just a test. The Grand Master in Ironforge sent me to another in Stranglethorn Vale.” Her pride in passing the test was evident. Carolyn nodded, remembering now that on their trip back to Menethil, Kamery had mentioned the warrior being seen in Stranglethorn Vale. However, she decided that it would be best not to remind the warrior of the extent of SI:7’s knowledge.
“I spent the next several weeks mining, not smithing,” Raynn shook her head, smiling wryly at the memory. “But then, Galvan taught me to work with imbued mithril.” She reached into her magical pack, and pulled out a vambrace of dark, shimmering metal. “I made this one with Trenton, some of the larger pieces with Galvan. I just need to finish the breastplate now.”
“That’s what you’re making now?” Elthas asked, and Raynn nodded.
“Order up!” The Goblin chef’s shout interrupted them. “I ain’t bringin’ it over!”
Raynn chuckled as she stood, waving them back down as they started to join her. “I’ll get it. Dirge’s cooking is worth his attitude, and he knows it.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Enchanted manacles are brought to Jaina
- Aerial surveillance reveals magic circle
- Kamery and Elthas investigate Alcaz Island in stealth
- Elthas identifies split trails, both dead ends to sea though</Synopsis>
            <Text>“A firemane drake?!” Disbelief colored Jaina Proudmoore’s voice. Beside her, Kamery felt the same disbelief and heard Carolyn’s quiet gasp of horror. She had heard rumors of black dragon-kin in the Burning Steppes north of Redridge, but had never seen one herself. But there was no denying the sleek black-scaled creature that had risen from Alcaz Island to attack Jaina’s gryphon rider on her reconnaissance flight.
After they had brought the manacles to Jaina, she had immediately requested the flight, knowing that Theramore’s guard wasn’t enough to assault the Naga-occupied island directly. Cassa Crimsonwing, apprentice gryphon master, had volunteered to fly the flight, but now she was flying for her life as they watched from the city ramparts. Cassa was skilled, Kamery realized, impressed, as the Dwarf guided her gryphon through evasive twists and turns away from the island—providing the general sense of direction, while still giving her mount the freedom to follow its own instincts too.
Wistfully, Kamery wondered what it would be like to have such a close partnership with a mount, to be able to fly like that. Wildhammer Dwarves were something else, she mused enviously. The tame gryphons that regularly flew travelers across the Kingdoms were placid, and only flew the routes that they had been trained on. Cassa’s mount seemed still half-wild, and together the pair skillfully evaded the black drake that chased them.
Thankfully, as they left the vicinity of the island, the drake turned back to its post, seemingly satisfied with its work. A few moments later, Cassa and her gryphon landed lightly on the wall beside the watching group. The Dwarf slid off the gryphon’s back, giving the mount a light slap on the shoulder and the majestic beast glided off the wall and back to its roost. Pulling off her helmet and goggles, Cassa approached.
“We didn’t get far,” she apologized.
“We saw.” Jaina spoke kindly. “Could you see anything of interest? Other than the drake itself, of course.”
“Aye, before the beastie rose up, I spotted a rune circle in a clearing, surrounded by buildings.” The Dwarf’s observations impressed Kamery. She hadn’t had very long over the island before being forced to retreat.
“Thank you, Cassa. Get some rest,” Jaina dismissed the gryphon rider distractedly. Turning to the small group with her, she shook her head helplessly. “A rune circle? Dragon-kin? The Defias have hedge mages among their ranks, but no one powerful enough to make use of such a thing! And why would the Black Dragonflight be interested in an island full of Naga. There are many unanswered questions, but one thing is for certain: the Defias have powerful allies.”
Looking around the group, Kamery saw the hopelessness on their faces—all except Elthas; the tall Kaldorei was still looking out at the foreboding island, a thoughtful expression on his face. As if feeling her attention, he turned to her, and she saw the beginnings of the idea on his face. Her heart clenched, knowing that he was thinking of trying to sneak onto the island, and knowing that if he went, she would go with him. They had to know more though, and force and flight were now both out of the question.
Reading her answer in her eyes, Elthas spoke. “The hydra were mostly at the northern end of the island. The dock area is approachable.”
Jaina frowned. “Theramore’s forces…”
Kamery pressed ahead with the druid’s idea, flinching at Carolyn’s sharp breath of realization. “Not Theramore’s forces. A more stealthy approach.”
Bryna’s red hat tilted, a sign that the mage was considering the idea, weighting the odds and risks. Kamery waited bemusedly for the verdict. It didn’t take long. “We’ve exhausted all other options. If they can get in and out without being seen…” Bryna’s head raised enough for her to meet Kamery’s eyes.
Kamery nodded. “We will.” She avowed. Am I trying to convince Bryna, who probably already knows the answer, or Carolyn…or myself?
Looking between the four adventurers, Jaina nodded heavily. “Bryna’s right, of course. We have no other options. I won’t order it though.” She hadn’t ordered Cassa either, Kamery knew.
Carolyn’s face was tight, when Kamery looked back at her, but she nodded, before approaching her sister and Elthas. Putting an arm around each of them, she pulled them close, whispering, “Take care, and come back.”
Elthas’s arms surrounded both sisters, and Kamery joined the embrace also.
After a moment, Carolyn stepped back, whispering a word of power. Kamery felt the surge of holy fortitude and smiled gratefully. Turning to look back out at the looming island, she shifted her focus to the task ahead.</Text>

273 Strong Verbs That’ll Spice Up Your Writing
17 Nov 2023  The Writing Craft


Do you ever wonder why a grammatically correct sentence you’ve written just lies there like a dead fish?
I sure have.
Your sentence might even be full of those adjectives and adverbs your teachers and loved ones so admired in your writing when you were a kid.
But still the sentence doesn’t work.
Something simple I learned from The Elements of Style years ago changed the way I write and added verve to my prose. The authors of that little bible of style said: “Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs.”
Even Mark Twain was quoted, regarding adjectives: “When in doubt, strike it out.”
That’s not to say there’s no place for adjectives. I used three in the title and first paragraph of this post alone.
The point is that good writing is more about well-chosen nouns and strong verbs than it is about adjectives and adverbs, regardless what you were told as a kid.
There’s no quicker win for you and your manuscript than ferreting out and eliminating flabby verbs and replacing them with vibrant ones.
How To Know Which Verbs Need Replacing
Your first hint is your own discomfort with a sentence. Odds are it features a snooze-inducing verb.
As you hone your ferocious self-editing skills, train yourself to exploit opportunities to replace a weak verb for a strong one.
At the end of this post I suggest a list of 273 vivid verbs you can experiment with to replace tired ones. What constitutes a tired verb? Here’s what to look for:
3 Types of Verbs to Beware of in Your Prose
1. State-of-being verbs
These are passive as opposed to powerful:
Is
Am
Are
Was
Were
Be
Being
Been
Have
Has
Had
Do
Does
Did
Shall
Will
Should
Would
May
Might
Must
Can
Could
Am I saying these should never appear in your writing? Of course not. You’ll find them in this piece. But when a sentence lies limp, you can bet it contains at least one of these. Determining when a state-of-being verb is the culprit creates a problem—and finding a better, more powerful verb to replace it—is what makes us writers. [Note how I replaced the state-of-being verbs in this paragraph.]
Resist the urge to consult a thesaurus for the most exotic verb you can find. I consult such references only for the normal word that carries power but refuses to come to mind.
I would suggest even that you consult my list of powerful verbs only after you have exhausted all efforts to come up with one on your own. You want Make your prose to be your own creation, not yours plus Roget or Webster or Jenkins. [See how easy they are to spot and fix?]
Examples
Impotent: The man was walking on the platform.
Powerful: The man strode along the platform.
 
Impotent: Jim is a lover of country living.
Powerful: Jim treasures country living.
 
Impotent: There are three things that make me feel the way I do…
Powerful: Three things convince me…
 
2. Verbs that rely on adverbs
Powerful verbs are strong enough to stand alone.
Examples
The fox ran quickly dashed through the forest.
She menacingly looked glared at her rival.
He secretly listened eavesdropped while they discussed their plans.
 
3. Verbs with -ing suffixes
Examples
Before: He was walking…
After: He walked…
 
Before: She was loving the idea of…
After: She loved the idea of…
 
Before: The family was starting to gather…
After: The family started to gather…

            <Title>Ragnaros Emerges</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Preparing for the epic fight.</Synopsis>
            <Text>At Varian’s word, the cowardly majordomo summoned his Elemental Lord forth. Although Ragnaros’s first arrival on this plane had been devastatingly dramatic, he was at much reduced power, cut off from his native Elemental plane. He had spent much of the ensuing two centuries trapped below Blackrock Mountain, bending the Dark Iron Dwarves to carry out his will, as he built up his strength. He was still unready though. Enraged, Ragnaros struck down his majordomo before turning his fiery fury on the assembled forces.
Raynn prepared to draw his ire, setting her shield firmly before her to absorb his blows. Although the air shimmered with the heat emanating from the Elemental Lord, her new dark iron plate protected her from much of the damage. She could feel Carolyn’s presence behind her, ready to fill her with healing energy, joined by a number of other priests and druids who been recruited to join them.
To her side, Broll roared as he flexed his massive claws. He would be ready to step in, should she fall. Beyond the ursine druid, she could see Varian and a paladin of the Silver Order. The King wielded his new sword, Shalamayne, an ornate enchanted Elven blade gifted by Jaina Proudmoore after Onyxia’s defeat. The paladin, Arixa, was a stern woman with a strong command of the Light. She had promised that every blow of her broadsword would be accompanied by holy echoes that would heal the minor wounds of all those engaged in combat.
Behind the Firelord, Kamery, Elthas, and Valeera lurked in the shadows, ready to weave their subtle, yet viciously effective, attacks; they were accompanied by several of Kamery’s compatriots from SI:7. Raynn had been surprised to see that Mathias Shaw himself had joined them. The spy-master was as competent at combat as he was at gathering information. She could still feel his curiosity about her past, but she no longer felt threatened by it.
Beyond the rogues, on the far side of a bubbling ribbon of magma, a cadre of hunters took aim, ready to pepper the Firelord with their projectiles. At their forefront stood Galena, a sturdy Dwarf female with twin braids that swayed in rhythm with her loading and aiming action.
Arrayed loosely around the perimeter, between the hunters and the healers, spell-casters gathered magical projectiles, ready to fling them with deadly accuracy. Bryna’s frosty aura was joined by several others, as well as swirls of arcane and fel energies.
Raynn felt a light moment of amusement as she remembered the grouchiness of the Gnome warlock who now stood at Bryna’s side. Despite his wizened face and white hair—although his head was balding—Dencey had admitted that he was barely older than they were. His appearance had been due to the drain of the fel energies that he now mastered. He had grumbled continually as they had descended deeper into the Core, his shorter legs working hard to keep up with the longer strides of the others.
The warlock, and the others, were focused on Ragnaros now, as Raynn swung her sword to draw his attention. Even in his weakened state, the Fire Lord’s attacks were powerful, imbued with elemental fire. Her dark iron armor served her well though, and she stood strong under the assault.
In the end, Ragnaros was no match for the might of the assembled force. After a hard-fought battle, the Elemental Lord was banished back to the Elemental Plane, and the Molten Core fell quiet.
In the weeks that would follow, Raynn knew that the Dwarves would be busy, as Magni considered reconciliation with the Dark Iron clan, now that they were free from the Fire Lord’s influence.
But for now, she felt only satisfaction, as her friends gathered around her once more. Looking across at Varian, surrounded by Broll, Valeera, and Fordragon, she saw her feelings mirrored on his face; a battle well-fought, among the presence of friends.</Text>
            <Notes>Chaos ensued. Ragnaros fell, dropping some cool pants. Everyone looked at each other in the quiet aftermath. &quot;So, same time next week?&quot; Raynn asked.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Carolyn and Elthas head south from Mirage Raceway, having bought water and a map.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The rattle and clank of the Mirage Raceway faded behind them as Carolyn and Elthas headed south. A shout rose up over the mechanical noises, as another race finished. Carolyn smiled at the memory of the animated—and occasionally agitated—discussions between the various groups of engineers. She hadn’t realized before that there were different schools of thought in the profession, but after several days of listening to debates on gadgets versus explosives, she understood a little. She and Elthas had stayed at the Raceway for several days, resting and watching the daily races between the mechanical vehicles.
They had their bearings again, having found a friendly Goblin willing to share a map—for a price, which they had gladly paid. The raceway hadn’t been the town that Elthas had supposed, but that lay just over the mountains to the south. They had also bought water, enough for both of them, plus Carolyn’s mount. Her coin purse was much lighter now, and with a flash of gratitude towards her sister, she hoped that Kamery had been successful in selling her kingsblood. Bryna had certainly seemed confident enough, and the mercenary mage seemed well-acquainted with making money.
Elthas ran at her side, and she wondered if it bothered him that he couldn’t lope ahead anymore. He had always seemed to cover at least twice as much ground as she did on any given journey. His new cheetah form paced her moonsaber perfectly. She smiled down at the mottled orange and black form, remembering his disgruntlement with the appearance. He still preferred the sleek black panther, and she found herself agreeing with him.</Text>

- Raynn and Bryna are in Gadgetzan at least four days before Elthas and Carolyn arrive.
- Caro and El arrive at the Raceway dehydrated and exhausted; they spend a couple of days recovering, and enjoying the races. Remember, they’re not in a hurry—they’re just exploring now.</Notes>

            <Text>31: Unity in Un’goro
As time passed, the group’s bonds grew and strengthened, as they continued to learn more of each other’s abilities. Their days were spent in a mix of individual pursuits and working together to tackle the occasional tasks the expedition members asked of them. Many evenings, they would spend time sparring with one another to hone their combat skills.
Then, one night, Kamery was jolted awake by Raynn’s pained cry fracturing the stillness. Instantly alert, she crouched, daggers in hand, scanning for danger in the dim light of the banked fire. The warrior was still asleep on her bedroll, although her face was drawn and pale in the amber glow. She cried out again, waking herself this time; her eyes were dark and haunted as she sat up.
Raynn’s cries had woken the others too, and they slowly stirred. Beside the warrior, Bryna blinked sleepily, her burgundy hair tousled around her shoulders. It was odd seeing the mage without her hat, Kamery noted offhandedly, as she resheathed her daggers and made her way over to Raynn’s side of the sleeping area.
Carolyn joined her a moment later, circling around to kneel by Raynn’s shoulder, as Kamery crouched beside one plate-clad knee. Raynn, they had learned, was comfortable sleeping in full plate armor; more comfortable than taking it off, it seemed. On the warrior’s other side, Bryna was sitting up, and Elthas was kneeling across from Kamery.
Raynn became aware of them, and her face regained some color, flushing in embarrassment. Carolyn laid a gentle hand on the warrior’s shoulder.
“What happened?” the priestess asked softly.
“Nightmare,” the warrior answered shortly. Her left hand rubbed absently at her side and Kamery noticed.
“An old injury?” the rogue asked, curious but keeping her tone neutral.
Raynn nodded, making an obvious effort to still her hand by resting it on her upraised knees with the other. “Long since healed,” she addressed Carolyn’s concerned look. Her eyes were distant with memory, avoiding their gazes and her face was closing up again in that familiar way. She couldn’t keep doing this, Elthas decided. Reaching out, he took Raynn’s hands in his, holding on as she tried to pull back.
“Memories are wounds too,” he told her. “If not treated, they fester and putrefy. Wounds need to be cleansed; memories too need purging. Perhaps not with us, but you need to share with someone, not just continue to bandage over them.”
Raynn stopped resisting as he spoke, and she seemed to be considering his words. He and the other Humans waited in comforting silence, broken only by the buzzing of the night insects, giving her the time she needed.
Her friends’ warmth surrounded her, reassuring her. Slowly, haltingly, Raynn revealed the painful tapestry of her past. They listened quietly, acceptingly, with few interruptions as she acknowledged what they had already somewhat guessed—that she had grown up in Lordaeron, and traveled to Kalimdor with the Orcish Horde.
The warmth of Carolyn’s hand on her shoulder, and Elthas’s firm grip on her hands steadied her, as she told them about her parents’ deaths at the hands of angry and frightened Humans at an internment camp. Her mother had been studying the Orcs; the family had been caught in the middle when Thrall’s army had arrived to liberate the Orcish prisoners.
They listened without judgment as she told them how Grom and Thrall had saved her, and delivered her to safety with the Dwarves of Dun Modr, who had subsequently fostered her to the Wildhammers in Aerie Peak. At the mention of Grom’s name, she felt Elthas’s hands tighten involuntarily on hers, but the druid gave her an apologetic look and continued listening as she explained that she had known Grom as a mentor and protector, not the demon-driven force of destruction he had been to the Kaldorei.
Bryna nodded thoughtfully as Raynn admitted to interrupting her gryphon patrol over Hillsbrad, to misdirect the Human army that would have caught the Orcs before they could safely depart from Southshore, and how Thrall and Grom had taken her with them to protect her from reprisal. The mage had already suspected that she had traveled to Kalimdor with the Orcs, Raynn knew from Bryna’s earlier questioning, thankfully cut off at the time by Kamery.
Carolyn’s arms surrounded Raynn as she told them what she knew about her injury; she had been with an Orcish patrol in Ashenvale when they had been beset by a demon and she had been incapacitated. She had passed out from the wound, and woken weeks later, in Jaina’s camp at Stonetalon Peak. Still uncertain herself about her rescuer, she omitted mention of the shadowy figure who had dispatched the demon before it could finish her off.
The judgment she had feared didn’t come. She had divulged even more than Jaina knew, her words a stream of memory that once started, she hadn’t been able to stop, but they accepted her. Raynn felt tears welling in her eyes, but it was, as Elthas had said, cleansing.
They had fallen into an exhausted, but peaceful, sleep not long after. When they awoke, there were a few lingering questions, which Raynn answered honestly, if occasionally hesitantly. She was still getting used to being this vulnerable, and the others were willing to give her time, for the wound Elthas had mentioned to begin to heal.</Text>

            <Text>Leaving Argelmach’s small office, they turned left, towards the far exit from the Manufactory. Bookshelves lined the wall to their left, and Raynn scanned them as she passed. Back in the Golem Lord’s office, the warrior had picked up some papers, and Kamery wondered what Raynn had found.
The open portal led to a stonework bridge crossing over the magma that bubbled far below the city. Heat and the acrid smell of molten rock rose up to them. The bridge was guarded by two pairs of fire elementals, but the experienced band dispatched them quickly.
On the far side of the bridge, a ramp led up into another chamber. From within, they could hear the raucous sound of multiple Dark Iron Dwarf voices. Varian looked ready to charge in, but it was Raynn who stopped him this time.
“They’re drunk.” The warrior sounded amused. She slowly walked up the ramp with her sword and shield stowed, the others following curiously. “Drunk Dwarves are very agreeable.”
Raynn was correct; as they entered a cavernous, split-level tavern, the noise of dozens of conversations washed over them, but despite a few curious glances, the Dark Iron Dwarves left them alone. Mugs clinked and clattered as the patrons imbibed a dark ale, its rich, smoky aroma pervading the room.
The lower level of the establishment was filled with long tables, lined with happily oblivious Dark Irons Dwarves. To the left lay a storage room filled with massive kegs of ale, while more kegs were visible on the upper level as well. A ramp connected the two levels on the right side of the room, and Raynn led them that way.
At the top of the ramp an ornately decorated iron door led out, presumably to the rest of the city. It was locked, however, and neither Varian’s key nor Kamery’s lock-picks would open it.
As the others ventured over to the bar at the far end of the upper level, Kamery was stopped by a light touch on her shoulder. Turning, she was surprised to see a female Sayaad carrying a tray of drinks. The seductive demonesses were rare on Azeroth, usually only seen when summoned by powerful warlocks.
The Sayaad smiled at Kamery, and despite the feral, predatory nature of the smile, the rogue felt as though the demon barmaid was trying to be friendly.
She looked much like others of her kind, with dark wings behind her shoulders and matching horns rising from above her ears. Straight, dark hair fell around her shoulders, which were bared by her revealing outfit. Her body seemed meant to attract desire, although her legs ended in glossy black hooves, rather than feet.
“Welcome to the Grim Guzzler,” she purred. “I am Mistress Nagmara.” Her face twisted in concentration, and her voice shifted, becoming less seductive. “My master, Plugger Spazzring, is a good boss, and I enjoy my work here. However, I find myself at a loss.”
Wide-eyed, Kamery absorbed Nagmara’s words as the Sayaad continued.
“Oh, the pains of love!” the barmaid exclaimed, placing her free hand over her heart for emphasis. “My dear Private Rocknot”—she blew a kiss to one of the nearby Dark Iron Dwarves, who blushed slightly and gave a small wave—“is vulnerable to my love. It is my nature, to destroy a lover’s soul. We cannot find happiness. You must help me! I know a potion to protect him, but I need a particular herb, and a skilled alchemist.”
Kamery’s eyes raised. Had the demon sensed the herbs in her bags, and her ability? Or was it just a guess or a desperate plea?
“I can see things mortals cannot,” Nagmara confirmed the first case. “Please, help us.” She gestured again to the Private, and he nodded hopefully. “I can make it worth your while,” the bartender sweetened the request. “I have the key.” She pointed to the locked door.
At the Sayaad’s knowing smile, Kamery chuckled. “Alright. What does it need?”
Nagmara set her tray down on a nearby table, ignoring the Dark Iron Dwarves emptying it of the drinks in short order. She pulled a small bag from a cleverly hidden dimensional pocket and handed it to Kamery. “Everything else is in there; it just needs gromsblood and the right touch. Visitors have been kind, but unfortunately, none were skilled alchemists.” She cast another sly, almost-seductive smile at Kamery.
Under Nagmara’s guidance, Kamery carefully mixed the ingredients, adding several leaves of gromsblood from her own pack. As the resulting potion fizzed and glowed a pale pink, the scent of roses pervaded the immediate area. Nagmara clapped her hands in delight, and Private Rocknot approached with anticipation.
True to her word, the Sayaad barmaid unlocked the door, slipping out with Rocknot to put the potion to use. Kamery shook her head and headed down the bar to rejoin the others, assessing the scene as she approached.
At the far end of the room, Raynn was deep in conversation with a more friendly-looking Dark Iron Dwarf in a small alcove. Varian, Broll, and Bryna were talking to the bartender, a cheerful mustachioed Gnome in a bright red robe and hat; the hat looked very much like Bryna’s, but with a tall pointed top rather than her flatter one. 
Standing atop the bar, Plugger paced from one end to the other as he spoke, gesturing expansively with his hands. Elthas and Carolyn sat at a nearby table, sipping on mugs of ale and eating roasted meat.
As Kamery joined her sister, Carolyn raised a questioning eyebrow as she slid over a mug and plate. After a sip of the dark, earthy ale, Kamery could only shake her head in bemusement as she explained.
“At least the door is open now.” Elthas found the bright side, as Raynn left her discussion and joined them. The warrior had a thoughtful look on her face.
Pulling a nugget of dark iron from her bag, Raynn held it up thoughtfully. “Lokhtos shared some good tips on working with the metal, but first, I need to learn to extract it. He doesn’t know himself, but he said”—she frowned—“to visit the Tomb of the Summoners.”
“Good news,” Bryna joined them, sipping on a mug of ale. “Plugger says that Dagran Thaurissan has gone to inspect the mines in the Searing Gorge. Ironfoe is still in the Imperial Seat.” </Text>

            <Notes>Plugger Spazzring owns and runs the Grim Guzzler, the bar in Blackrock Depths. He has summoned Mistress Nagmara, a Sayaad, to work as his barmaid. Nagmara is unlike many of her kind, and after working at the Grim Guzzler for a long time, she has come to appreciate Plugger as a fair and generous master. She enjoys the work, and has fallen in love with one of their regular customers, Private Rocknot. Unfortunately, the natures of the Sayaad does not permit love - whenever they get close to another, their lust destroys their lover's soul. Nagmara has devised a potion that will protect Rocknot for a short time, and she has had other adventurers bring her most of the ingredients. Now, she only needs some gromsblood and a skilled alchemist to mix it properly. Luckily, Kamery can provide both. Kamery makes the potion, and Nagmara and Rocknot immediately slip out the back door to try it out, leaving the door open behind them.</Notes>

            <Title>Hunting Tichondrius, Interupted</Title>
            <Text>I moved through the shadows, my demonic runes casting an eerie glow in the darkness as I tracked Tichondrius through the Ashenvale forest. The haunting whispers of the trees concealed my presence, and I stumbled upon a gruesome scene—a slain orc patrol lay strewn across the forest floor, victims of the dreadlord's merciless assault.
In the midst of this carnage, I discovered a lone survivor—a human warrior, pinned to a tree by Tichondrius's cruel spear. The dreadlord loomed over her, poised to deliver the final blow. The sight, a stark reminder of the vulnerability that mortals faced in the war-torn world, gave me pause.
Tichondrius, unaware of my presence, was about to end her life when my blades, shimmering with demonic energy, found their mark. A swift, calculated strike severed the dreadlord's connection to this world. Tichondrius crumbled to the forest floor, defeated.
I stood amidst the aftermath, faced with a choice—continue my relentless pursuit of demons or extend an unexpected mercy to the mortal before me. The conflict within me mirrored the chaos of the forest, torn between the path of the demon hunter and the complexities of mortality.
I approached the wounded human, the glow of my demonic runes casting an otherworldly light upon her pale face. Her eyes widened in a mix of fear and awe as I reached for the cruel spear pinning her to the tree.
&quot;Stay still,&quot; I commanded, my voice edged with a stern determination. The words held an unspoken weight, acknowledging the fragility of her situation. As I removed the spear, the young warrior winced, the pain etched across her features.
&quot;Who... what are you?&quot; she managed to stutter, her eyes flickering between my demonic form and the now lifeless body of Tichondrius.
&quot;That matters little. What matters is you're alive,&quot; I replied, hastily tearing a strip of cloth from my tattered cloak to fashion a makeshift bandage. The forest around us seemed to hold its breath as I tended to her grievous wound.
&quot;Rest now, mortal. This world is far more perilous than you could have imagined,&quot; I added, my gaze penetrating hers with an unspoken warning. The demonic energies swirling around me served as a testament to the dangerous path I tread.
—
Illidan melted into the shadows as he left the young warrior near Splintertree Post. The power surging within him from the Skull of Gul'dan still echoed in his senses, a constant reminder of the risks he had taken. He watched from the concealment of the dense foliage as the orcs discovered her, their shouts echoing through the night.
Raynn lay unconscious, the pallor of her face stark against the shadows of the forest. Thrall, the orc Warchief, rushed to her side as the sentries alerted him. The chieftain attempted to channel shamanistic healing, the green energies flickering around his hands. The power of the Horde's leader was potent, yet the wound inflicted by the demon's spear proved stubborn.
Concern etched Thrall's brow as he witnessed the limited success of his healing attempts. Raynn's breathing remained shallow, and her features reflected the struggle between life and the encroaching darkness. The orc leader, driven by both duty and a newfound empathy, continued his efforts to mend the grievous wound.
Raynn's fate teetered in the balance, a delicate dance between the life she clung to and the darkness that sought to claim her.</Text>

            <Text>Raynn felt a flash of gratitude towards Kamery, as she strode ahead of the questioning mage. Passing a stand of fir trees, she used the thick, fragrant branches to hide their small group from the nearby watchtower. Tarren Mill lay to the north, so their route threaded between the village and the towers to the south.
Much of her knowledge of this area was from the air, rather than ground, but in some ways, that made the navigation easier. She could easily picture the positions of the towers along the main east-west road. The same road that she had stood on five years ago, and lied to an army.
Her memories were interrupted by another question. “What if we didn’t do this?” Carolyn mused. “The Horde has done so much damage.”
“Varian wouldn’t have been traveling to Kalimdor to get kidnapped,” Kamery added, but her tone showed that she knew that wasn’t the only concern.
Raynn was about to speak, to give in to the emotions that this situation was rubbing raw, but Elthas shifted out of form to answer first.
“No,” the druid stated firmly. “Thrall’s Horde were instrumental in the defense of the World Tree.”
Raynn looked at the druid in surprise. She had forgotten how long-lived the Kaldorei were. “Were you there?” Had he also met Thrall and Jaina?
But Elthas shook his head. “No, I was too young. I heard it from the elder druids though. The Alliance and the Horde both, held back the demons long enough for us to summon the Wisps. No matter what else they’ve done, we can’t forget that.” From the corner of her eye, Raynn saw Bryna’s hat moving, as the mage nodded her agreement.
With a nod of her own, Raynn led them up a small hill. Her pace increased, her blood pounding in her ears. They were almost there. Stay in control. After everything he’s done for me—I won’t let Thrall down.
At the crest of the hill, the solid stone walls of Durnholde came into view, still intact and pristine. Thrall would change that, although not today. Raynn closed her eyes briefly, pushing back the flood of memories that battered at her like a ship in a storm.
She couldn’t wait to purge them in the flames of the incendiary charges she carried. Couldn’t wait to burn the internment camp to the ground. She had been too young then, but not anymore. Her fists clenched at her sides.</Text>

            <Title>A Crumpled Up Note</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Elthas explores the Dark Iron Highway
- Finds the crumpled up note</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Kamery slipped silently through the larger chamber, Elthas explored further beyond the iron grate, and discovered that the passageway he was exploring led to a wide, paved roadway. Lined with groups of Dark Iron Dwarves who were alternately patrolling the highway or stopping to practice group maneuvers, the area presented a challenge. Padding quietly in the shadows, Elthas progressed slowly, careful to avoid confrontations.
The way opened out into a wider plaza, leading up to a wide gate decorated with massive carvings that echoed the doors into the mountain above. However, he noticed that the tops of these carvings held lookout posts, with windows looking down over the highway. A passageway opened in the edge of the gate, which would connect the two sides when the gate was closed.
Slipping stealthily through the ajar gate, Elthas found himself on a bridge over a lake of bubbling magma far below. The scent of molten rock intensified the already oppressive atmosphere, eliciting longing thoughts of the lush jungle of Un’goro Crater in the druid.
The bridge led to a hallway lined with fire elementals, and beyond he could see a massive anvil of dark iron. A larger fire elemental was pacing around the anvil, and the druid didn’t think that he would be able to slip between it and the edge of the ledge.
Kamery had taken on one of these elementals alone, he knew, but she had also needed potions and had been badly injured. In his feline form, he wouldn’t be able to use potions or heal himself, so he decided to turn back for now.
As Elthas returned back through the gate, he took note of more narrow windows in the stone walls high above on either side. Movement within suggested that they also housed guards watching the approach to the gate.
On his way back to rejoin Kamery, he passed a small side passage that led in the direction of the chamber she was investigating, so he turned that way. Halfway along it, he passed a solid iron door set into the rough stone wall. Decorative etchings on the door matched the architecture of the door below, and he thought that this must lead into the garrisons overlooking the highway.
A scrap of paper caught under the lower edge of the door caught his attention. After checking that the passage was clear, he shifted out of his feline form and bent to retrieve it. The note was stained and barely legible, but he could make out a few words. One in particular caught his attention, prompting him to slip the note into his pack: ‘Windsor’.
Shifting back to feline form, his ears twitched as he discerned the sounds of combat approaching the central chamber. The rest of their friends had reached the antechamber. Broll’s ursine roar sounded out, and Elthas reflected on the older druid for a moment.
Broll had been a well-known, yet mysterious, figure to the younger druids in Darnassus. He and Elthas had spoken while cooking dinner the night before, but the other druid been reticent about his past. Broll had complimented Elthas’s instincts about Varian, while still chastising him for his forwardness.
Elthas had accepted the advice, but he knew himself, and knew that his exploratory nature would not easily be quenched. Traveling with his friends helped though, knowing that his inquisitiveness was well-balanced within the group. Wondering what Kamery had found on her exploration, Elthas slipped back into the shadows to rejoin the others.</Text>

            <Title>The Cheese Master</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Raynn and Kamery rejoin the others in the Trade District
- Talk to Trias
- Trias tells them they'll have to use &quot;less than legal&quot; means to deal with Lescovar</Synopsis>
            <Text>Bryna looked around the bustling Trade District from under the brim of her red hat. Wide streets paved in white stone radiated out from a large intersection. To the south, the main gates of Stormwind loomed, the portcullis raised in this relatively peaceful time. Alert guards stood to either side of the gates, although she knew that these days, their duties mainly consisted of giving directions to confused visitors to the city. Small shops lined the streets, signs offering everything from armor and weapons to cheese and wine.
Casting a longing glance at the trading house, the mage thought wistfully of her days spent buying and selling magical items and reagents, always for profit of course. She was still with Elthas and Carolyn though, and wouldn’t desert her new friends to ply her trade. Idly, she wondered how long this friendship would last. Her restlessness, never allowing her to remain in one place for long, had always disrupted any nascent bonds before they could truly take root. However, something seemed different with these two, and their other, blade-wielding, companions. The five had come together so well in just a short time, and it left her longing for more.
Her gaze caught sight of the two familiar figures now, approaching the central intersection where she and the two healers waited. They were walking in silence, a distant look on Raynn’s face. Bryna straightened, and Elthas took notice, loping over to the approaching pair to bring them back to the group. She and the others had decided to move to this more central location after the warrior and rogue had left them at the Stockades; it was along the route, so they had been hopeful of a reunion here.
Kamery glanced around, her eyes lingering on the cheese shop, of all places. “I’m hungry,” the rogue announced, unexpectedly. She gestured to the cheese shop.
Raynn nodded. “Trias Cheese, that sounds good.” Something in the warrior’s voice hinted at more than just cheese though.
Bemused, Bryna followed the pair, as all five entered the shop. She knew of Elling Trias by reputation; the man had opened his cheese shop a decade ago, and stocked both local and exotic varieties. A bell jingled overhead as they pushed open the door, and their noses were greeted with the aromas of a bewildering number of cheeses. Elthas sneezed.
“Hey,” the shop owner barked. “No animals!” An imposing figure, with a black leather eye-patch over his right eye, Trias stood cross-armed behind a wide counter at the back of the store. The whitewashed wall behind him was framed by darker wooden supports, which anchored several shelves laden with blocks and wheels of cheese from all over the known world, and perhaps even beyond.
Carolyn frowned, retorting, “He’s a druid.”
Mollified, the shop owner backed down. Black hair, as long as Bryna’s own shoulder-length locks, complemented a drooping black mustache. “How can I help you?” he asked, looking the group over, his gaze lingering disapprovingly on Carolyn’s battered and stained robes. Bryna sighed inwardly; she needed to get the priestess to her parents’ shop, and soon.
Kamery stepped closer to the counter, ignoring the wheels of aged cheddar on the wooden surface between them, as she spoke in a low voice. “Shaw sent us.”
Trias heaved an exasperated sigh. “You’re kidding? Not again… Elaine!” he called out towards a back room. A stout blonde woman in blue overalls emerged. Taking in the scene, she nodded in understanding, and smoothly took Elling’s place behind the counter. Muttering discontentedly under his breath, he beckoned the group towards a staircase leading upwards.
Mounting the stairs, Bryna noticed that the wooden railing under her hand was worn and smooth. They were far from the first visitors to be directed this way. Elling and Elaine’s reactions had also indicated as much. She tried to remember if she knew anything about his past, but came up blank. His reputation among the merchants of Stormwind began and ended with his shop.
Reaching a cramped room at the top of the stairs, Elling turned on the group, fixing his glare on Kamery. “What does Shaw want now? Of all the nerve…” he grumbled.
Kamery met his bluster with a cool look as she answered, “We’ve uncovered Defias activity in the city. They seem to have connections with Lord Lescovar, through an assassin named Maelik…or Marzon.”
Elling’s expression hardened. “Defias, you say? What will you tell me next, that Deathwing is still alive? All right, tell me everything, from the beginning. Don’t leave anything out.”
Raynn told the story, relaying their actions and Thelwater’s words with practiced brevity. Kamery interjected occasionally when she felt the warrior’s terseness was omitting important details. Neither mentioned the details of the confrontation with Thedd; Raynn only coldly stated the outcome. Elling listened intently, not interrupting.
As they finished, he nodded. His attitude had settled down now, and he was gruffly businesslike as he calmly stated, “What you need to do is divvy out a form of justice that’s not…legal. Lescovar and Marzon need to be dealt with, and swiftly. An old friend of mine, Tyrion, has been watching Lescovar for a couple weeks now. He should be able to help you end this.”
Not legal. Bryna drew a breath at that as her mind readjusted. He was right, of course. A nobleman was too powerful to confront directly. With the corruption in the House of Nobles, they wouldn’t persecute one of their own, no matter the evidence—and both of their key witnesses were now dead.</Text>

            <Title>Mind Vision</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Meet Vaelan
- He has the unadorned Seal, but hasn't been able to get the gemstones</Synopsis>
            <Text>Once more, Carolyn and her friends entered the magma-lit interior of Blackrock Mountain. They turned upwards this time, fighting through a small garrison of Orcs. The hallways and ramps that they followed were well-built, matching the style of the Dark Iron Dwarf city below. After several twists and turns, they reached a small balcony looking out into the mountain’s cavernous hollow center. Looking at Forgewright’s tomb, suspended above the magma lake, Carolyn wondered if the Dwarven architect had also designed this part of the mountain.
Whether he had or not, the area was now firmly in the hands of the Orcs. Beyond the balcony, the Orcish stronghold continued further into the mountain. Somewhere in that maze of ramps and hallways dwelt the black dragon champion that they sought. According to Haleh, he resided in the upper reaches of the spire, but from where they stood now, all paths seemed to lead downwards—all accessible paths, that was. 
An upward-leading ramp was blocked by an ornate brass door. From behind the door, footsteps approached and receded in a regular rhythm that suggested guard patrols. Neither Kamery nor Raynn had been able to locate a lock or opening mechanism. Elthas and Bryna confirmed that it contained powerful magic, but they’d had no idea how to open it either.
Now, they considered venturing into the heavily populated Orcish city below, to see if they could find another way around. Before they did though, Carolyn suggested that she could try to find their way using mind vision spells. She was glad that it was just the five of them now; she wasn’t sure Varian, or Lo’Gosh, would have had the patience for the spell-work.
Carolyn cast the spell, looking around through the eyes of Orc after Orc, into the twisting hallways of the lower reaches. There didn’t seem to be any paths upwards though.
But up on one ledge, she found a mind that she couldn’t see into. From the eyes of others, he appeared to be just another Orc, but to her magical vision, he was something completely different. Curious, she broke her spell to return to her own mind, and her friends.
“There’s something strange, not far in,” Carolyn frowned, remembering the strange mind that she had been unable to penetrate. Even as she tried to find the words to explain it, the Orc in question approached them from the ramp leading below.
Raynn had already been standing protectively ahead of the others, and she raised her sword and shield now. The Orc was unarmed though, and didn’t look threatening. In the guttural language, Raynn addressed him. Carolyn knew that Raynn had spent time with Orcs, and knew their culture, but she was still somehow surprised to hear the actual language coming from a Human.
Translation wouldn’t be necessary, however. As the strange Orc approached, his form shimmered with arcane energy. His green skin and tusks faded away, revealing a Human face, half-hidden by a thick reddish mustache and beard. A red hood covered his head. His red and gold robes swirled briefly, as though touched by wind, then settled onto the body of a Human male.
“Greetings,” he spoke in the Common tongue. “I am Vaelan.” He smiled at Carolyn. “I sensed your spells.” His gaze turned to Bryna, his smile fading. “You carry an artifact of the Black Dragonflight. What is your purpose here?”
Raynn’s eyes narrowed, her sword and shield still at the ready. Vaelan had stopped just out of her reach.
There was something about Vaelan though, something that felt nurturing, rather than the destructiveness that the Black Dragonflight embodied.
“We seek the blood of Drakkisath,” Carolyn told him. She felt the surprise of her Human friends; Elthas was also relaxed, seeming to also trust Vaelan.
Vaelan’s eyes flashed red momentarily. “Our goals may be intertwined then.” Looking past them at the sealed door, he pulled a flat disc from a pocket. “The way may be opened with this Seal, but the gemstones that power it have been out of my reach thus far.” The surface of the disc had three indentations on it, where gems could be inset.
“And you would help us?” Raynn was still suspicious. “Why?”
Vaelan smiled humorlessly. “The Black Dragonflight has inflicted great pain on my family. I would see them destroyed.” His voice was low and intense, his words reminding Carolyn of Varian Wrynn.

            <Title>Sparring and More</Title>
            <Text>The Garrison at Lunarfall stood as a bastion against the challenges of Draenor, its walls echoing with the sounds of training and camaraderie. In the midst of this fortified haven, Varian Wrynn found himself drawn to the training grounds where Raynn, the valiant warrior from Stormwind, honed her skills.
The sparring sessions had become a routine, an opportunity for both to refine their combat prowess. The air was charged with the energy of clashes between steel, the sound of blades meeting in a rhythmic dance. Varian, observing Raynn's precise movements, couldn't help but admire the grace with which she wielded her weapons.
As the sun dipped below the Draenor horizon, casting an amber glow upon the Garrison, Varian stepped forward to engage Raynn in a sparring match. Their blades clashed, each strike resonating with a distinct melody of combat. Varian's gaze locked onto Raynn's eyes, a silent acknowledgment of the unspoken connection that had grown between them.
With each exchange, the tension heightened, and the atmosphere shifted. The sparring evolved into a dance, bodies moving in sync, and the line between combat and something more elusive began to blur. Varian's movements became deliberate, charged with an intensity that transcended the confines of the training grounds.
Raynn, sensing the shift, met Varian's gaze with a mixture of determination and something deeper. The sparring became an intricate dance of mutual understanding, and beneath the layers of armor and blades, an unspoken attraction simmered.
Varian, fueled by a growing desire, allowed himself to be ensnared in the ebb and flow of the dance. Their blades moved with a shared rhythm, and in the intensity of the moment, the Garrison walls seemed to fade away, leaving only the connection between Varian and Raynn.
As the sparring session reached its zenith, their movements became more fluid, more intimate. The clang of steel on steel echoed the unspoken tension that lingered in the air. Varian, a monarch on the battlefield, found himself captivated by a different kind of conquest—one that unfolded in the quiet intimacy of Lunarfall's training grounds.

All of her amour is highly enchanted and disguised with illusions

Thinks (thought) history was boring because it was already done with; changing her mind with Bronze Dragonflight involvement.
Knows that the Horde were instrumental in the victory over the Burning Legion in the Third War, but no details, just a vague and grudging mention in a Kaldorei history book.
Knows that the Horde and Jaina were the only two trips to Kalimdor five years ago.

            <Title>Incendiaries</Title>
            <Text>Raynn’s guidance had served them well through the unfamiliar landscape, and now they approached the solid stone walls of Durnholde Keep. The warrior had led them in a circuitous path that had skirted a small town, and kept them out of sight of several watchtowers. She knows this territory, and in this time period; not its present-day Scourge-ravaged and Forsaken-occupied state.
Looking at the imposing outer walls, the solid keep in the center, and the makeshift cabins that housed the Orcs, Kamery wondered how they would take it all on and extract the someday Warchief.
“El and I can scout,” she began, but Raynn cut her off.
“They want a distraction. We’ll give them one.” The warrior’s voice was tight and hard, but controlled.
Kamery glanced at Carolyn. If Raynn charges in and draws the ire of the Keep’s guards, will Caro be able to keep her healed?
Raynn noticed the glance, and she softened slightly. “Don’t worry, I’m not suicidal.”
Not suicidal, no, but she efficiently cut a path through the defenses of the keep with a cold ruthlessness that matched even the most hardened assassins of SI:7.
She didn’t touch the Orc prisoners though, Kamery noticed. The Orcs, deep in their lethargy, paid the group little heed, only shuffling quietly out of the way if they were too close to a melee. Their apathy made Kamery’s heart ache; she had heard about the strange malaise, of course, but seeing it firsthand was completely different.
The Orcs watched listlessly as Raynn entered the first hut with her satchel of incendiary charges. The others waited at the door, watching for approaching guards. A handful of Orcs stood around the stove at the end of the meager room. As Raynn set the first charge, Kamery saw the warrior say something to the Orcs. They looked at her curiously, but, the rogue realized, not in confusion; they understood her words.
As Raynn turned back to rejoin the group at the front entrance, the Orcs shuffled slowly out of the smaller door at the back of the hut.
“Won’t they interfere?” Bryna asked.
“No.” Raynn’s answer was soft, her voice and face sad. She feels more for the Orcs than the Humans here.</Text>

            <Title>Entrance to the Molten Core</Title>
            <Synopsis>- hey look, big bad is down there. let's avoid.</Synopsis>
            <Text>As the stealthy trio slipped through the shadows on their clandestine mission, the rest of the party made the short trip through the tunnels to the Black Forge. The only place where the rare ore could be smelted, the Forge was located at the end of a rickety bridge made of metal grating, leading out over a river of slowly flowing molten rock. The heat rising from the magma was incredible, powering the forge.
Varian, Carolyn, and Bryna watched from the safety of solid stone as Raynn confidently made her way along a narrow bridge and settled in with her ores.
Bryna was pleased that the scrap of information had paid off. Nothing more than an idle curiosity when she had discovered it, the poorly translated list had been tucked away with the rest of her obscure knowledge, almost all esoteric and unused. It had come to mind as she had been sorting through Raynn’s finds in Un’goro Crater however, as she had realized that they fulfilled the list. Out of curiosity, she had set the required items aside.
The warrior’s work would take some time, she had warned them. Nearby, a wide bridge of worked stone crossed the river of magma, leading to a gaping cavern that shimmered and pulsed with elemental energy from within.
Staring intently at the distant cavern, Varian gave voice to his impatience with waiting, “We must be close to the Firelord’s lair. That may be the entrance across the way.” 
Bryna slanted a look at the King from below the brim of her red hat. Surely he wasn’t suggesting that the three of them tackle Ragnaros’s inner sanctum alone. Carolyn’s face reflected her thoughts, but Varian’s self-deprecating smile reassured them.
“I do not suggest we confront the Firelord today.” He gestured to the elementals guarding the bridge. “But perhaps we could reach the entrance and gather information?” He was solicitous enough to ask Carolyn’s approval.
The priestess glanced at Bryna, and the mage shrugged easily; her frost spells were quite effective against the elementals, so long as Carolyn could keep the King alive. He still hadn’t obtained a shield.
After a moment of consideration, Carolyn nodded. With a final glance at Raynn, deep in her work at the forge, they mounted the short slope to the bridge.
Varian’s feral roar drew the attention of the first two elementals immediately. Caution, Bryna decided, was recommended. Although her polymorph spells wouldn’t work on elementals, she could, and did, freeze one in place, out of reach of the King. Her spells and Varian’s swords made quick work of the first, then the second, and they crossed the wide bridge.
Like all Dwarven work, the stones were well-cut and fitted together closely, making the span comfortingly solid. Bryna glanced up and down the river of magma. Its source was multiple streams oozing out from the stone walls, not far beyond where Raynn worked. To the other side, the stream, and the wide, deep chasm it occupied, curved to the left out of sight.
On the far side of the well-made bridge, they faced two more elemental guards. Once again, Bryna froze one in place, but this time, Varian’s wild blows shattered the delicate bonds of frost. Under the onslaught from two elementals, the King’s ferocious assault faltered, and he stumbled. Carolyn’s face was tight, her holy spells a constant stream, but the King was taking too much damage.
Eyes narrowing, Bryna focused her attacks on the elemental guard that Varian seemed less focused on. While standard tactics dictated concentrating damage to fell one enemy first, she knew that if she drew the elemental’s attention, Carolyn would be able to keep the King alive. Allowing the King of Stormwind to die was a decidedly bad idea.
Her gambit worked, and the elemental broke off to pursue her. Employing her frost spells to chill and slow its movements, Bryna worked her way back across the bridge, careful to keep an eye on her surroundings and not fall off the edge. Dark Iron Dwarves had a poor grasp of safety, it seemed. Their bridges had sheer edges, without so much as a guardrail to warn the unwary.
Although her intermittent spells weren’t doing much damage, she had bought Varian and Carolyn the time they needed, and it wasn’t long before they joined her and felled the final guard. The entrance to the Molten Core lay open before them, and they crept closer to peer in.
Their exploration was short-lived; just around the first bend, a pair of massive molten giants stood guard over the first bridge leading down into the Firelord’s abode. Even Varian was willing to retreat at the sight, for the time being.
As they walked back across the bridge though, he vowed, “When I retake my throne, all of Stormwind’s armies will march in here and destroy the Firelord once and for all.” Bryna and Carolyn nodded in agreement. When that day came, they would be there, as would, they hoped, Raynn and her new protective armor.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Characters</Title>
            <Text>Types of Characters
There are two broad categories of characters and many different subtypes:
1. Protagonists
2. Secondary Characters
Most stories only have one or two protagonists, or main characters, which means that most of your characters will be secondary characters. What is a protagonist?
Protagonist definition: The primary character of a story. The character at the center of the plot whose choices drive the story and whose fate determines the story’s outcome.
Protagonists tend to be dynamic characters who have a character arc that changes throughout the story.
Protagonists also tend to be point of view characters, meaning the narrator follows their point of view or they are a first-person narrator. (More on point of view here.) These characters carry the narrative, and in a story told in third person limited point of view, they will be the only character whose thoughts and emotions the reader can see.
Warning: Unless you're writing a love story, which frequently has two protagonists in the couple, be careful about having more than one protagonist. There's a reason George R. R. Martin is still (still!) trying to finish A Song of Ice and Fire. The more point-of-view characters you have, the more complicated your narrative, and the more problems you face.
There are three types of protagonists:
The Classic Hero. Think Harry Potter, Jane Eyre, Atticus Finch, or Katniss Everdeen. Classic heros are brave, are selfless, and try to do the right thing.
The Anti-Hero. Think Severus Snape, Huckleberry Finn, or Han Solo. Anti-heroes are not noble, rarely do the right thing, and might, in ordinary circumstances, be considered the villain.
The Ordinary Hero. Think Neville Longbottom, Holden Caulfield, and Jane Austen's Emma Woodhouse. These characters have an even mix of admirable and less noble qualities, just like most of us.
Secondary characters are the next category, and they contain all the other types of characters, including:
Villain or Antagonist. Not every story has a villain, but for the ones that do, the villain is the chief source of external conflict.
Love interest and love rival. In stories with a love plot or subplot, the love interest is the chief love interest for the protagonist and may even be a protagonist themselves. They may be static, meaning they don't change over the course of the story, or dynamic, meaning they do change, but they add to the romantic tension. Similarly, most love stories involve rivals, another love interest who creates a love triangle and increases the romantic tension.
Foil Character. A secondary character who acts as a mirror to the protagonist and is often very similar but different in one major way that allows us to better understand the protagonist's personality and choices.
Mentor. The mentor is a character who steers the protagonist, helps get them out of trouble, and provides chances for reflection. A mainstay of the hero’s journey plot structure, in many types of stories, without a good mentor, the character’s journey will end in tragedy (e.g. think about Hamlet, who had no mentor).
Sidekick. A sidekick is a character who supports the protagonist. Besides the protagonist and villain, they have the most opportunity for characterization and provide dialogue opportunities and insight into the character’s mindset. Sidekicks appear in all genres, from romance (e.g. Mercutio from Romeo and Juliet) to adventure (e.g. Samwise Gamgee from Lord of the Rings) to mystery (e.g. Inspector Beauvoir from the Inspector Gamache series) and more.
Side Characters. Side characters often have fully developed personalities, long interactions with the protagonist, and perhaps even deep backstories. However, they rarely make decisions or change throughout the story.
The Chorus. A term from playwriting, these characters may have names and vague descriptions, but they do not have fully developed personalities and are chiefly there to serve as bystanders.
Suspects. Specific to mysteries and thrillers, suspects have fully developed personalities and they serve as objects of exploration for the investigator. They should all have motives and appear at least somewhat guilty of the crime, if only to serve as red herrings.
#These tend to be static characters with a flat character arc, at least within the confines of the story. However, great writers know that all characters have their own arc. Your job as a writer is to choose how much of that arc to show the reader in the story.
6 Characters Your Protagonist Needs to Have Around
Your protagonist may be the star of the show, but they can’t do everything alone. Just like it takes a village to raise a child, it takes an entire cast of characters to help your hero along on their journey.
#Do you think Harry Potter could’ve accomplished all that he did if it were just him on his own out there against Voldemort? Of course not. He had friends who stuck by him, teachers who came and went, and a whole assortment of villains that drove the plot forward. Your main character needs those people, too.
Let's take a look at the people who surrounded Harry and the roles they played in his life. Which of these character types appear in your story?
1. Mentor
This would be the Dumbledore of the story. Usually an elder, but not necessarily, they’re the one who always has some sort of nugget of wisdom right when the protagonist needs it. They teach and steer the main character away from stupid decisions (though they may not always succeed at that).
If your hero ran off without anyone to guide them, they’d probably end up in heaps of trouble.
2. Confidant
Being the hero of a story puts a lot of pressure on a person. They can’t handle all of these secrets and worries alone! Whenever they need some advice or a listening ear, this is the person they go to.
This could be a friend, relative, teacher, anyone willing to offer help and encouragement. Sirius Black could be a good example of this.
3. Antagonist
Whether it’s your typical “big bad,” a school bully, or that cashier at the grocery store who gives the protagonist dirty looks, this is the character who offers up some conflict. It’s someone they can butt heads with, rant about to the confidant, maybe use a picture of their face as a dartboard.
This character doesn’t even have to be evil. As long as they and the main character are far from bosom buddies, you’re in the clear. Think of them as Snape.
4. Parental Figure
As a lot of heroes (such as Harry) are tragically orphans, the parental figure doesn’t have to be a mom or dad. They don’t even have to be related by blood. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were some of the best versions of parents Harry could’ve asked for.
#This is the person who never forgets a birthday, makes a pot of the best chicken noodle soup when your protagonist has the flu, and hugs them goodnight.
5. Sidekick/Partner-in-Crime
Is your protagonist planning to break into a high-security building in the dead of night in order to get those top-secret blueprints for the villain’s underground lair? This character doesn’t even need to be asked to come along; they’ll be there dressed in dark clothing and with a Plan B, C, and Q in mind.
As sidekicks have to be tight with the hero, they generally end up being the best friends, too. Ron and Hermione were Harry’s partners-in-crime, without a doubt.
6. Comic Relief
Every story gets a little—or a lot—dark sometimes. But if the reader got stuck under that gloomy storm cloud for the entire ride, chances are they’d get tired of it.
That’s the cue for this character to pop in and crack a joke or two, cheering up both the reader and your protagonist. Fred and George were definitely the comic relief of the series.
Get Creative
Of course there are many more types of characters your protagonist in particular might need around. For example, if you’re writing a romance, they’d need a love interest, and maybe even a “wrong love.” It’s up to you ultimately to decide which of these they need, when, and where.
If you wanted, you could combine certain characters to make someone brand new and unique. What would a parental figure who’s also a partner-in-crime look like? How about an antagonist/comic relief?
The choice, and the story, is yours. Just don’t leave your protagonist stranded, all right?</Text>

            <Title>WTB Portal to SW</Title>
            <Text>Bounding through the wide streets of Darnassus, Elthas circled around the thick trunk of Teldrassil, enjoying his homecoming, however brief. His sensitive nose filled with familiar scents, and his keen vision absorbed the sweeping boughs stretching through the tree-top city. Although his feline form wasn’t as good with color, his memory retained the vibrant greens and pinks of the leaves, which grew and fell throughout the year.
No time to enjoy the foliage now though, he reminded himself; he was on a mission! Slowing down, his gaze shifted from the natural beauty to a careful study of the Humans and Gnomes gathered around the central trunk, paying no mind to the few Dwarves among them—the sturdy race didn’t take well to magic, and he was looking for a mage.
As he approached the broad bridge that spanned the lake in the middle of the city, he appreciated the courtesy of the outsiders to stay in this central area. If he had to search the entire city, this would take too long. Carolyn had described her sister as cool and confident; if Kamery needed help, he knew it must be urgent.
Turning onto the bridge, he detected the familiar scent of magic and his eyes narrowed. A Human female sat on a bench at the edge of the span, studying a book. He sniffed again, trying to determine if the strong scent was coming from her or the tome. No matter, only a mage would be reading a magic book. He loped up to her, and shifted out of form smoothly.
The mage started, looking up at him from under a wide-brimmed red hat. He reminded himself that he should shift first, then approach, but it was too late now. He tried to atone for it by bowing graciously. He felt clumsy, and too tall next to her.
“Greetings. My friend and I were looking for a mage, to buy a portal to Stormwind.” He looked at her hopefully.
The Human gave a short sigh, glanced down at her book for a moment, then decisively snapped the heavy tome shut with a thud, not bothering to mark her page. “Gold up front,” she transitioned from studious to mercenary with a speed that dizzied even Elthas, who knew that his own thoughts were often a whirlwind.
The druid nodded, looking around for Carolyn; she had wanted to stop by the temple to say goodbye to Tyrande before leaving Darnassus. “We can pay. I’m just waiting for my friend. What’s your name?” He could at least be friendly while waiting.
A small smile curved her deep red lips. “Bryna. Yours?”
“Oh! Elthas. My friend is Carolyn.” Elthas sat down next to Bryna. It felt better to not be looking down so far. “Have you been in Darnassus long? How do you like it? Are you studying magic here?” He paused—the Kaldorei eschewed the Arcane, so that was a silly question.
Bryna blinked in surprise, but gamely answered his questions as rapid-fire as they had been asked. “Long enough. Yes. From books, yes.” As Elthas paused to absorb her answers, she posed her own question. “Have you been to Stormwind before?”
Elthas shook his head, excitement blossoming anew at the prospect of exploring a new place. He inspected the mage with interest. She almost seemed out of place in the vibrant city. Other than her hat, the rest of her clothing was fairly plain. She wore a brown linen vest, well-tailored and elegantly embroidered, but simple in style. Matching short pants hugged her legs to the knees, and soft brown boots covered her feet. Around her wrists and elbows, she wore bracers trimmed in gold thread. He wondered if his senses had led him astray. She didn’t look like any powerful mage he had seen before, with their ornate robes and elaborate staffs and wands.
She felt his appraisal, and smirked slightly. “My parents are tailors.” She gestured at her clothing. “We work with enchantment.”
Eyes widening in surprise, Elthas asked, “Was that the magic I sensed? I thought it was you or the book.”
Bryna looked at him, intrigued. “You can sense magic?”
“In feline form, yes.” Elthas shifted easily, happy to see that Bryna didn’t jump this time. This close, it was easier to distinguish the scents. The book was the weakest of them all. Her clothing was indeed enchanted, but not very strongly; it was mostly illusions. Bryna herself though, she was interesting. He leaned closer, examining her hand, through scent and magical sight.
“El!” Caro’s admonishing voice cut his examination short, and he realized perhaps he had once again overstepped some boundary. It took effort to be polite, and his feline curiosity had gotten the better of him. Carolyn had once jokingly told him the Humans’ saying “curiosity kills the cat.” He hoped it wasn’t true.
Backing away from Bryna and shifting out of feline form, he gave his friend an apologetic look. Carolyn gave him a rueful, but understanding smile.
“This is Carolyn?” Bryna stood to join them. She held a worn wooden quarterstaff in her hand now, the book tucked away in her backpack.
Elthas nodded eagerly. “Caro, this is Bryna. She’s a mage.” He remembered the mention of gold and turned to Bryna. “How much?”
She didn’t hesitate. This was apparently something she did often. “Five gold.”
Carolyn faltered slightly at the cost, but then reached into her pouch to produce the coins. She carried the all of proceeds of their shared adventures. Although his pack transformed with him, his druidic magic shrinking his belongings to a manageable size in the purse around his cat’s neck, he had found that gold coins didn’t respond as well. They weighed him down.
Carolyn handed over the coins, and they watched with interest as Bryna began casting the portal spell. Motes of arcane magic swirled around both of her hands, and he could feel the tingle of power against the druidic tattoos that twined up his arms. He and Carolyn were well-used to the portal from the base of Teldrassil up to Darnassus itself, but this would be the first time they had traveled by a mage’s portal. He wondered if it would feel much different. It was much further too, so would it take longer or still be instantaneous?
Watching the arcane magic coalesce between Bryna’s hands, Elthas’s thoughts shifted to what challenges might be waiting for them on the other side. Again, Carolyn’s praise of her sister echoed in his mind. Carolyn had told him that Kamery had been the one to encourage her to continue her priestly studies, after their parents had died of illness just over a year ago, leaving the sisters to fend for themselves. Kamery had also been the one to encourage her to follow her dreams to Darnassus.
Carolyn had spoken highly of her sister, painting a picture of a competent, intelligent, level-headed Human. If she had felt the need to reach out for help…
“You should come with us!” He spoke the words as soon as the idea formed in his mind.
Both Bryna and Carolyn looked startled, the now-complete portal shimmering in the road between them, a wavering vision of a stately city of white stone visible in its center. Carolyn tilted her head slightly, silent question in her eyes. She was puzzled, but trusted his judgment.
Elthas forced his thoughts in order. His sense of Bryna’s magic intrigued him. She had a lot of raw power. Although it seemed mostly untapped, as she was still young, she could still be a boon. “We are going to aid Carolyn’s sister in a dangerous task. We could use a competent mage.”
Bryna looked from him to Carolyn and back for a moment, considering. Carolyn seemed to understand something. “We can’t afford to pay you up front, but there may be a reward afterwards. Kamery tends to do things that entail that.”
Bryna’s lips twitched in a smile again. Elthas thought, hoped, that maybe she was amused at Carolyn’s assumption, rather than just pleased at the thought of payment. The brim of her red hat covered her eyes, especially from his height, so it was difficult to read her expression. Then the brim of the hat bobbed as she nodded. “Sure, why not. I’m getting bored here anyway.”
Elthas shifted back to feline form for the journey, excitement surging through him. A new city, a new way of travel, and a new companion! He eagerly jumped through the shimmering portal. The two Human women followed close behind him, an old friend and a new one.
A kaleidescope of sensations washed over him. Arcane magic tingled against his tattoos, now dyed into the fur of his shoulders, as the familiar sights and scents of Darnassus mingled with, and then were replaced by, something entirely new and unfamiliar. As the portal’s magic faded, Elthas looked around, ready for new adventures and exploration.</Text>

            <Title>26-07-01-L70-Battle for Hyjal, Take Two</Title>
            <Text>In the seventh month of the twenty-sixth year, Raynn finds herself thrust back in time by the bronze dragonflight to the pivotal Battle of Mount Hyjal, which transpired in the year 21. As she materializes in the past, she joins Jaina Proudmoore at the human encampment, where a profound shock registers on Jaina's face upon seeing the older Raynn.

Realizing that this Raynn is the matured version of the girl she left recovering in Theramore, there's a brief moment for a quick explanation. The urgency of the situation, however, quickly takes precedence as hordes of undead assail their position. The impending onslaught demands their immediate attention, leaving little room for extended conversations.

With the tumultuous Battle of Mount Hyjal unfolding around them, Raynn and Jaina are forced to focus on the imminent threats, navigating the chaos of the past to secure a future free from the clutches of the Burning Legion.

---

**First Greeting:**

As Raynn materializes in the midst of the human encampment, the shock on Jaina's face is unmistakable. She recognizes the face, the determined gaze, but this Raynn is not the unseasoned warrior she has come to know in recent days. This Raynn bears the weight of experience, the mark of battles fought and victories earned.

**Jaina:** (Staring in disbelief) Raynn? But you... you're...

**Raynn:** (Smirking) Older? Yeah, time travel can do that.

**Jaina:** (Eyes narrowing) Time travel? This is not the time for jokes, Raynn. We're facing the Legion, and—

**Raynn:** (Interrupting) I know the stakes, Jaina. I've been through this before. Just trust me.

As the urgency of the situation presses upon them, there's little room for further explanation. The echoes of the younger Raynn's determination linger in Jaina's mind as they ready themselves for the impending onslaught.

**As Jaina Calls the Retreat:**

In the heat of battle, as Jaina reluctantly calls for a retreat, she spots Raynn maneuvering through the chaos with a self-assured grace that belies her earlier uncertainty.

**Jaina:** (Shouting over the clamor) Raynn, fall back! We can't hold this position!

**Raynn:** (Nodding) I've got it, Jaina. Go, I'll catch up.

As the retreat sounds, Raynn doesn't falter. Instead, she heads further up the mountain, her steps purposeful and confident. Jaina watches for a moment, a mix of confusion and curiosity in her eyes.

**Jaina:** (Muttering to herself) Who is she?

Unbeknownst to Jaina, the Raynn she barely knows is about to carve her own path through the history of Mount Hyjal, leaving an indelible mark on the battle against the Burning Legion.

---

**Arrival in the Horde Encampment:**

As the echoes of battle reverberate through the Horde encampment, Raynn materializes, her armor resonating with the hum of magical power. Thrall, overseeing the preparations, turns at the disturbance, his eyes widening with recognition.

**Thrall:** Raynn? But you're...

**Raynn:** (Smirking) Older? Yeah, time travel can do that.

**Thrall:** (Staring in amazement) Time travel? What brings you here?

**Raynn:** (Briefly) Long story. We can catch up later. Right now, we've got a Legion to deal with.

**Thrall:** (Nodding) Indeed, we do. Join our forces; we'll need every hand.

**Throughout the Battle:**

As the battle unfolds, Thrall watches Raynn move with a practiced grace, her combat skills surpassing the memories he holds of a once-adept, yet inexperienced, young warrior. The weight of experience is etched into her every movement.

**Thrall:** (Muttering to himself) She's grown into a formidable warrior.

Raynn, too, senses the recognition in Thrall's gaze but dismisses it, focusing on the immediate threat. Their paths cross multiple times, a silent acknowledgment passing between them amidst the chaos.

**Raynn:** (Briefly) We make a good team, Thrall.

**Thrall:** (Smiling) We always did.

**As the Camp Is Overrun:**

As the Legion's forces overwhelm the Horde encampment, the once-mighty defenses crumble. Raynn fights valiantly, holding her ground at the entrance to the camp. Thrall, overseeing the broader battlefield, feels a pang of concern for the soldiers under his command.

**Thrall:** (Grimacing) We can't hold much longer.

Just as hope wavers, Jaina Proudmoore arrives, her magical prowess evident. She swiftly teleports the remaining survivors to safety, leaving only a few, including Raynn, behind.

**Raynn:** (Briefly) Good luck, Thrall.

**Thrall:** (Nodding) And to you, Raynn.

With a flash of arcane energy, the Horde encampment is left eerily silent, the battleground now devoid of its defenders.

Raynn, with a heavy heart, turns away, ready to face the next challenge up the mountain. She knows the sacrifice is necessary, the memories she's leaving behind a burden she bears alone.</Text>

            <Title>The Secrets of Dark Iron</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Gloom'rel reluctantly teaches Raynn to smelt dark iron, for a price
- Gloom’rel demands payment in gems; Raynn has them, because Bryna read something somewhere and held back just the right things.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Splitting the attention of the remaining six apparitions between them, Raynn and Broll stood back to back in the center of the room. Although she cast occasional glances over to check on Carolyn’s prisoner, Raynn focused most of her attention on the three before her.
She and Broll worked well together, their collaboration honed by the battles up to this point. Her world narrowed to the fight surrounding her, revolving around the attention of her foes.
Kamery, Elthas, and Varian also worked together well, focusing their attacks on one target at a time. Much like elementals, spirits connected to the mortal plane could be harmed by their enchanted weapons. While the damage would not destroy them utterly, it would banish them temporarily, and all six Summoners’s spirits were dispatched in turn.
As her breathing and senses returned to normal, Raynn turned to the seventh Summoner. Although his eyes glowing red and angry within his chains, the spirit bent to Carolyn’s will in reluctant cooperation.
“I am forever denied the touch of stone,” the ghostly Dark Iron Dwarf lamented, his non-corporeal voice echoing oddly. “I will never again know the glory of shaped iron…”
“Tell us your secrets,” Varian demanded, his voice resonating with royal authority mixed with the fading adrenaline of battle.
The Dark Iron Dwarf smirked within the chains. Although he was bound, his will was strong and he was not entirely submissive. One translucent arm left a faintly glowing trail as it gestured to the sepulcher behind him, and Raynn saw a golden chalice atop it.
“You wish to learn the craft? You wish to learn to smelt dark iron?” he challenged. “Appease me then; show me a sacrifice and I will consider it!”
As she listened to the Dark Iron Dwarf’s spirit list his requirements, Raynn’s heart sank. The list included rare and expensive gems and ingots, and Bryna had been insistent on selling almost everything of value.
Digging into her bags anyway, Raynn was surprised. She did indeed have all of the requested items. She looked up at the mage, to find an enigmatic smile dancing on the full lips under the red hat brim.
Shaking her head at the depths of the mage’s knowledge, Raynn placed the precious items into the chalice. Almost immediately, they shimmered and disappeared, and she felt a surge of knowledge flood through her.
“May your skills in working dark iron serve you well, Raynn.” The ghost addressed her by name, although they had never spoken their names to him. “But do not let your knowledge corrupt you…as it corrupted us.”
With the ominous warning, the apparition became ethereal, then faded away completely. The golden chains dissipated, leaving Carolyn to sag into Kamery and Bryna’s supportive arms.
Varian took Raynn’s attention. “Did you learn what you needed?” the King asked her.
With a nod, the warrior added, “The ore must be smelted here, in the depths of the Mountain. There is a special forge nearby.”
Grimly, Varian accepted the information. “Then our path is twofold. We must acquire this metal, and retrieve Ironfoe.”
“Perhaps,” Broll broke in, “it may be best to split our efforts. The Imperial Seat is well guarded, and to go in with force would likely bring the entire city down on us.”
The druid smiled, but shook his head, at Varian’s look of eager acceptance. “There are those among us who could venture there with less attention. Perhaps we should investigate quietly, while you accompany Raynn to this forge.”</Text>

</Synopsis>
            <Text>After regrouping, they made their way along the ramp to the ornately embossed brass door that blocked the upper reaches. As Vaelan approached with the Seal, the door split down the middle, swinging open to reveal the chambers beyond.
Carolyn watched the red dragon carefully. She wasn’t entirely sure how much effect her healing had had on him, but thought that he had added some of his own magic. He seemed recovered now, at least, as he led them into the vestibule behind the door.
The floors were paved with large flagstones, set in geometric patterns of light and dark stone. Flickering torches set in sconces on the walls lit the room, adding a smoky tinge to the pungent aroma of spices coming from crates stacked along the walls. The walls themselves were made of well-fitted stone bricks that echoed the dual-tone pattern of the floor.
Alcoves set into the walls of the vestibule held enchanted runes, and one at a time, they cleared out the Orcs guarding the runes, and Vaelan deactivated them. At the last, another sealed door at the far end of the room swung open.
Through the second door, a short ramp led upwards, into a large chamber filled with Orcish summoners, working binding spells on a flame elemental. At their intrusion, the summoners’ concentration faltered, and the elemental broke free. Between Carolyn’s friends and the elemental, the summoners were quickly dispatched.
The elemental proved somewhat more of a challenge, and not for the first time that day, Carolyn found herself wishing that Raynn had been able to work on the dark iron armor she had recently learned how to make. Her enchanted mithril armor was highly effective against physical blows, but the heat of elemental attacks completely ignored the armor.
The elemental itself lacked armor though, which made it vulnerable to Kamery and Elthas’s attacks, and Bryna’s frost-bolts were devastating against the flame. As the elemental fell, Carolyn peered into the next room. It was filled with dark, pulsing eggs.
“Carefully, now,” Vaelan cautioned. “They are ready to hatch, and the whelplings will be hungry. Although small, they could easily overwhelm us.” He led the way through the clutch of eggs to a ramp leading upwards.
After another room filled with Orcish soldiers, they passed into a smaller side tunnel. Although the narrow tunnel led in several directions, one ended in a sharp drop-off, and another was barred. The only option was into a large arena with balconies overlooking it from either side.
As they cautiously crossed the deep chamber, the door they had come in slammed closed behind them. A guttural laugh came from one of the balconies above, as two figures entered from one side.
The first was a large, cruel-looking Orc stood watching them. His skin was dark ash-grey and face was covered with criss-crossing scars, leaving him with only one red-glowing eye. Although his head was bald on top, long braids of white hair fell forward over his shoulders, matching his neatly-trimmed beard. His red-dyed armor was lightweight, except for heavy, spike-covered pauldrons, and he carried a polearm with a long, wicked single blade.
“Excellent,” he yelled at them in Common, “More fodder for my legions.” On the balcony across from him, more Orcs filtered in to watch the spectacle, as Carolyn’s friends gathered protectively around her. Raynn’s head swiveled as she watched for approaching threats.
Following the Orc, and towering over him, was a large black dragonspawn. Even larger than Wyrmthalak below, he was similarly armored in red dragon-scale. Vaelan attempted to cast a fireball, but it fizzled as it struck an invisible shield surrounding the balcony. The dragonspawn chuckled, a deep, ominous sound.
“Let not even a drop of their blood remain upon the arena floor, my children.” The dragonspawn, General Drakkisath, ordered, as the wide gate at the far end of the arena creaked open, and several Orcs marched through, accompanied by a group of black whelplings.
Raynn charged forwards to engage them, as the others moved to attack. Carolyn settled into her role, healing the warrior, while also watching the whelplings. As one strayed too close in its swooping attack, she struck it from the air with her staff.
As the first group was dispatched, a second group of Orcs joined the fray. Their attacks were weak though, and once again, Carolyn and her friends were victorious. As a third group entered, the Orc leader grew increasingly agitated, pacing back and forth along his balcony.
“Fools,” Drakkisath yelled at his soldiers. “Kill the one in the dress!” He spoke an unfamiliar, sibilant language, but Carolyn could understand his words; obviously so could the Orcs and whelplings, as they swarmed towards her.
Bryna’s frost rooted most in place, while Raynn, Kamery, and Elthas continued to cut them down. Carolyn frowned up at the balcony, seeing the General’s eyes fixed on her. She swatted away another whelpling.
“This cannot be!” General Drakkisath glowered as more of his soldiers fell. “Enough of this! Rend, deal with these insects.”
“With pleasure!” The Orc Warchief leaped down into the arena, landing in front of Carolyn. “I will tear your spine out with my bare hands!”
Carolyn stepped back, dodging out of range of the swing of his polearm. “That’s not bare hands,” she mumbled in annoyance. Most foes had the decency to ignore her efforts, preferring to focus on her allies who were actively damaging them. This Orc’s attention was vexing.
Raynn intervened, raising her shield to block the Orc’s next swing, but he was too focused on Carolyn, and she could not hold his attention. Backtracking, the priestess felt her foot hit a rock, and she stumbled, losing her balance. The Orc’s one eye flared with triumph.</Text>

            <Title>Southshore - Thrall</Title>
            <Text>As the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the dockyards of Southshore, Thrall focused his concentration on the subtle magic of Farsight. The energies rippled, revealing the lands beyond his direct line of sight. A familiar tension gripped him – the weight of leadership, the burden of the Horde, and the uncertainty of the unknown that lay ahead.
His sharp eyes picked up on the approaching human army from Durnholde Keep, marching with a determination that hinted at a singular purpose. Thrall furrowed his brow; the delicate balance between the Horde and the humans seemed on the brink of disturbance.
In the midst of the unfolding drama, a solitary figure emerged – Raynn, the young woman who had once crossed their path at a critical juncture. His connection with the Farsight allowed him to witness her interaction with the humans. A deceptive dance, orchestrated with a purpose that eluded Thrall at first.
Turning to Grom, Thrall relayed the events he had witnessed. &quot;Grom, Raynn has intervened. She misdirected the human army, leading them north. It seems she seeks to protect us.&quot;
Grom, ever perceptive, foresaw the repercussions. &quot;When the humans realize her deception, they'll turn their anger on her. We made a blood oath to protect her, Thrall. We must act.&quot;
The invocation of the blood oath echoed in Thrall's thoughts. The ancient pledge, forged in a time of desperation, bound them to protect a human child, a promise made by Grom to a dying man. Thrall's resistance surfaced, a reluctance rooted in the growing uncertainty of their journey.
Yet, Grom's insistence carried the weight of honor. &quot;The immediate threat is from the humans,&quot; Grom asserted. &quot;Having Raynn with us ensures we can protect her. We cannot leave her to face their wrath alone.&quot;
The strange desire to shield Raynn from impending danger tugged at Thrall's resolve. A silent acknowledgment passed between the two leaders, sealed by the echoes of a blood oath. Reluctantly, Thrall nodded. &quot;We ride out, then. Let us find Raynn.&quot;
As they spurred their war wolves into motion, Thrall's mind grappled with the unfolding events. The unpredictable path to Kalimdor now entwined with the responsibility of protecting a young human woman – a connection fate had woven into their journey.</Text>

            <Text>In the meantime, behind the heavy, ornately-carved throne, Elthas’s senses picked up a whiff of powerful magic from the base of the seat. Kamery investigated the area, her experienced eyes identifying a hidden compartment. With nimble fingers, she worked it open, revealing Ironfoe within, the weapon thrumming with power. At Broll’s look of admiration, Elthas almost purred with delight.
Drawing the shadows around themselves once more, the three stealthily made their way back the way they had come. With their prize now resting in Kamery’s bag, they rejoined their friends at the Black Forge.
It wasn’t long before Raynn completed her work. She now had several ingots of purified dark iron, ready to be worked into armor pieces.
The reunited band retraced their steps, back through the Summoner’s Tomb, the Grim Guzzler, and the garrisons, to return to the despondent Marshal in his prison cell. New hope flared at the return of Ironfoe and his notes, and Windsor readily joined them to leave the Dark Iron stronghold and return to Morgan’s Vigil.</Text>

            <Title>Wanted: Hogger</Title>
            <Synopsis>Raynn charges into battle against Hogger, but is outmatched, until Kamery intervenes.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn jogged down the winding road south of Stormwind, her newly crafted plate boots bringing an added challenge to her steps. Despite the unfamiliar weight, her strides remained strong and purposeful on the worn cobblestones and packed dirt. She adjusted easily to the increased burden, thanks to her warrior’s training.
The work had been satisfying, even enjoyable, and she eagerly anticipated completing the set of armor someday. Her scrounged chain mail vest and leggings were serviceable, but the leggings were worn, their loose links clinking as she moved, and the vest fit poorly. The solidity of the iron comforted her, and she knew that with Dane’s guidance, she had made them well.
Her eyes drank in the lush landscape of the unfamiliar forest as she searched for her quarry. Green grass grew in the wide spaces between the massive trees, and sun-dappled shadows flickered across the worn cobbles of the road as the wind rustled the leaves on the boughs overhead. The air was warm, and rich with the earthy aroma of freshly turned earth and the sweet fragrance of flowers. The contrast from the windswept, snow-covered mountains of Dun Morogh was incredible.
Four years ago, she had emerged from a magical portal into Stormwind—a bustling, sprawling city unlike anything she had experienced before. White stone buildings had towered all around, as far as she could see, standing free and proud, a sharp contrast to the mountainside homes of the Dwarves, or the rough tents and cabins of her childhood.
Alone and intimidated, she hadn’t stayed long—only long enough to learn about the gryphon masters and the easy flight north to Ironforge. A year ago, the Great Flood of Ironforge had prompted her return south. Despite being her father’s homeland, Stormwind’s grandeur still occasionally overwhelmed her.
With a shake of her head, setting her ponytail swaying, Raynn pulled her attention back to the present, the warm forest breeze embracing her with the rich scents of earth and life. Stormwind’s surroundings, she reflected, held their own rewards. Notice boards in several locations throughout the city often carried posters seeking adventurers for various tasks.
The image of one particular poster hung in her memory: “Wanted: Hogger. 5 Gold Reward”—a sketch and description had followed. The promise of five gold spurred her onward. While she managed to scrape by with the tasks she undertook for the Dwarves, that additional gold would prove invaluable in acquiring the materials for her new armor.
Her eyes scanned the forest ahead, and she listened intently for sounds beyond the birds chirping overhead and wolves howling in the distance. Appreciation for the new sensations the environment provided blended with alert watchfulness for her quarry.
Rounding a bend in the road, Raynn spotted movement in the trees to her left. A massive gnoll ambled nonchalantly through the forest, a spiked club slung over his shoulder. Brown leather trousers and vambraces were his only protection. His dappled grey and brown fur seemed designed to blend in with the surroundings, but his movements made him stand out. He fit the description from the poster perfectly.
Hogger didn’t seem aware of Raynn’s presence yet, and as she approached, he casually swung his mace to kill a rabbit that had the misfortune of darting too close to him. He made no move to retrieve the corpse to use its meat or skin, but just grunted a cruel bark of laughter and continued on his way, his heavy footsteps thudding on the forest floor.
Her eyes narrowed in distaste, and Raynn gauged the distance, picking up her pace once more. The gnoll heard her approach and turned to face her, his face twisting in a cruel grin. Raynn charged forward, committing herself to the battle, eager to start the familiar dance of combat. While she had enjoyed the past few months of learning about her heritage in this unfamiliar land, she exhilarated in the purity of combat. The immediacy, the physical dance—the precise movements as her body became an extension of her will—those were the things that drove her thirst for battle.
Hogger’s first swing struck with unexpected force, easily deflecting her initial strike as part of a powerful counterattack. Blocking the blow with her shield, Raynn felt the reverberation through her left arm, momentarily numbing it. Stumbling back, she struggled to keep her shield in position. The gnoll was strong; his blows rained down with ferocity.
Fumbling to get her sword in a position to attack, she felt the weapon snag on a root. The gnoll’s relentlessness gave her no opportunity to free it. As she tugged at the tangled weapon, desperation surged through her. Her shield arm ached from the repeated assault. The scar on her left side twinged in a flash of memory. Raynn’s jaw clenched, her grip tightening on her shield. She refused to fail again.
Suddenly, the great gnoll gave a grunt of surprise—and pain. In the brief respite, Raynn worked her sword free from its entanglement, glad to have its comforting weight firmly in her grip once more. At the edge of her vision, she saw a shadowy blur cross the verdant clearing behind her opponent. Sunlight glinted on metal and Hogger squealed in pain again. Angrily, the gnoll turned to the new foe—a slight figure, wearing only leather armor. Protective instincts welling up in her, Raynn slammed her shield into the gnoll’s now-unprotected side. He looked back over at her, almost disbelieving.
“Yeah, I’m still here,” Raynn taunted him with a smirk, as she gave a flick of her head, sending her long ponytail back over her shoulder. Hogger turned back to her, swinging his crude mace at her once more. Raynn blocked the powerful, but clumsy, blow with her shield. Nails embedded in the wood scraped against it with the squeal of metal against metal. No longer off-balance, she settled into the familiar rhythm of combat. If she could hold his attention, perhaps the other combatant could land a blow to a vital area.
Her stance solid once more, Raynn withstood the gnoll’s increasingly frantic attacks. The shadowy figure darted behind him and struck with surgical precision. The metallic scent of blood filled the air. Keeping her attention focused on the furious gnoll, Raynn tried to catch a glimpse of her newfound ally. Whoever this person was, they were skilled and agile, darting in and out of her vision. Raynn felt a surge of gratitude for the assistance.
Another flash of memory washed over her—of another savior in another forest. Her scar throbbed, remembering the spear that had impaled her, even though the wound had long since healed. Pushing the memory away, Raynn growled in denial. That day would not be repeated. Never again would she fall, only to wake weeks later in another place. She set her feet, the iron boots anchoring her on the soft dirt of the forest floor. Her worn sword swung again, its well-honed edge cutting into the gnoll’s leather vambrace.
The fight ended quickly. As Hogger fell and the adrenaline of battle began to fade, Raynn got her first good look at her savior. The Human was young and female, like Raynn, although lithe and slim, with short dark hair. She was dressed head to toe in supple black leather, unadorned except for dull iron buckles securing criss-crossing belts at her waist. Wicked daggers gleamed in her hands, their edges now dripping with gnoll blood, and remnants of something more sickly and sinister. The twin weapons were plain in appearance; however, Raynn recognized the superior craftsmanship. They were smaller than her preferred choice of weapons, but they fit their wielder perfectly as she held them with easy confidence.
As Raynn focused on slowing her breathing, the other woman broke the silence first. “Thanks for taking all the hits.” Her keen grey eyes crinkled in a friendly smile, above the black bandanna that covered the lower half of her face. “I’ve seen you training at the Stormwind barracks. I’m Kamery.”
Raynn’s eyebrows rose. “I’ve never seen you.” She paused a moment, remembering the building across the lawn from the barracks, the headquarters of SI:7, Stormwind’s clandestine organization. Somehow the building always seemed alive with activity, despite her never actually seeing anyone enter or leave. She studied Kamery cautiously, as she tugged at her mail vest to straighten it.
Kamery’s eyes danced with amusement and satisfaction. “Good.” She bent down to the gnoll at their feet, grabbing hold of one ear, dagger moving in a swift slice. Raynn stiffened slightly, as she remembered the wanted poster, with its demand for proof of demise. The roguish young woman glanced up, amused. “He’s got two ears, doesn’t he?”
Raynn felt relief flowing through her as a short laugh escaped. Kamery deftly relieved Hogger of both ears and tossed one of them to Raynn, who caught the grisly prize. The rogue wiped her blades on the grass before standing again. The familiar scent of blood and death permeated the clearing, likely to draw flies and scavengers in no time.
Wrapping the gnoll’s ear in a scrap of worn leather, Raynn considered her next step. “Westbrook garrison is near here?” she asked Kamery, hoping for guidance in this unfamiliar terrain. She could hear the splash and burble of water nearby, presumably the river border with Westfall, so the watchtower must be close. Although the forest felt open with the widely spaced trees, it was still difficult to see far in any direction.
Kamery studied Raynn for a moment, her penetrating gaze a bit disconcerting. “Not from around here, are you?” Her voice was friendly, but the question hadn’t quite been a question. “It’s just to the north. Come on.” She deftly flicked her daggers back into their sheaths at her hips, and started off to the north. She moved with an easy grace and fluidity; her boots made no sound on the forest floor. Raynn followed, now self-consciously aware of her own heavy steps.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Varian/Lo'Gosh, Broll, Kamery, Raynn, Carolyn, Elthas, Bryna all enter BRD
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Early the next morning, they rose as the sun cast its dim light through the pervasive haze in the area. After a quick, cold breakfast, they mounted up and set out towards the mountain that loomed in the distance. Elthas’s tail twitched when he saw that Broll’s travel form was a great stag. The graceful beast was impressive, and mouthwatering. Firmly, Elthas pushed his cheetah’s instinct aside.
Once the site of fierce battles between the old Horde and the Alliance, where leaders from both sides had met their ends, the soaring, hollow volcano was now firmly in the grasp of hostile forces. However, the determined, well-armed group met little resistance as they made their way up the wide road leading to the mountain. 
A wide bridge of well-fitted stone spanned a deep valley before the mountain. At its far end, a pair of massive doors led into the steep rock face, their outer panels featuring detailed carvings of past Dwarven Kings. The doors stood ajar, leading to a dog-leg tunnel, lit by hanging lanterns.
As they passed the first bend, Varian dismounted, halting the party. The others followed suit, with Broll shifting back to Kaldorei form. Elthas had noticed that the older druid didn’t linger in his animal forms. Although they had spoken for some time, the previous night, Broll hadn’t said much about himself. Instead, he had skillfully guided the conversation to inquiries about the younger druid and his friends. Elthas’s head tilted contemplatively, as he half-listened to Varian explain what he knew about the mountain.
“According to John”—the King’s lip curled derisively—“he and Windsor encountered Blackrock and Dark Iron war parties just inside. The Marshal was taken away to the depths by the Dark Irons, so presumably the Orcs occupy the upper reaches of the mountain.”
“The central area is clear now,” Kamery said, stepping out of the shadows near the far end of the entryway. Elthas blinked in surprise; he hadn’t noticed the rogue leave. His tail drooped with the realization that he should have also scouted ahead.
Varian nodded, accepting the report. “Then we should take advantage of the lull.”
The Human King led them forward, around the final bend and into the vast central cavern. A wide paved ledge ringed a wide hollow, halfway between a lake of bubbling magma below and a soaring ceiling far above. Around the curve to their left, another gate led out towards the Searing Gorge, north of the mountain.
In the center of the area, a large chunk of stone hung, supported by heavy iron chains with links wider than Elthas’s Kaldorei height. Several smaller tunnel entrances and ledges had been cut into the monolith. Seeing a possible path along the thick chains to the lower depths, the group crossed to this floating island and made their way into its interior.
In the center, they found an ornate tomb of stone. As they approached, a ghostly Dwarven figure shimmered into sight. Startled, Elthas sat back on his haunches. His whiskers twitched in interest as he studied the apparition. Although he had encountered, and had to fight, angry spirits before, this one seemed calm enough. In a way, it reminded him of the wisps around Darnassus—the remnants of his ancestors. He hoped that the wisps wouldn’t mind the comparison with a Dwarf too much.
“Greetings,” The ghost said, imperiously staring down Varian and Raynn’s drawn weapons. “I am Franclorn Forgewright. Are you here to learn of the Spire and of Dark Iron?”
Elthas caught an amused smile dancing on Carolyn’s lips, behind the warriors. The priestess had an even better understanding of spirits than he did. As Varian and Raynn hesitated uncertainly, Carolyn stepped forward between them, asking, “What is it you want us to know?”
As Forgewright gave a small bow, his attention on the priestess, Varian and Raynn sheathed their weapons, retreating to the sides. The ghost told them that his clan had become corrupted by Ragnaros, and he wanted them stopped. In a hidden compartment below the tomb, he revealed a key that would unlock the gates to the Iron Dwarf stronghold.
Grateful for the assistance, however unusual, they continued downwards, feeling the heat from the molten rock below rising up around them. They reached a narrow ledge at the bottom, and gratefully made their way into a wide underground quarry that opened up to one side.</Text>

- Jaina has to return home
- They teleport to Theramore
- Soridormi can't help
- Bryna returns to Stormwind</Synopsis>
            <Text>Back in the throne room, Bryna thoughtfully watched Broll and Elthas leave, the older druid’s words echoing in her head. Another Dragonflight indeed. I know one of those too. Settling her thoughts in order, she turned back to the King.
Jaina was bidding farewell to Varian. “I apologize, but I must return to Theramore. There is much that needs my attention.” Her voice was tense, and Bryna wondered how much the discovery of the brood-mother’s lair had thrown her quiet town into disarray. They had been well-used to the omnipresent threat of the Horde, but that threat had been mitigated by the tenuous treaty between Jaina and Thrall. Black Dragons, she supposed, would offer no such peace.
Varian brushed off the apology. “Of course, I understand completely. Thank you for your assistance this day.” Although it still carried a hint of tension, his voice was smooth and polite.
This wasn’t the same rough warrior they had fought beside in the depths of Blackrock Mountain, Bryna realized, as Jaina teleported away. However, king or not, she wouldn’t stay silent with her idea. “There is another Dragonflight.” She paused, remembering the Bronzes’ secrecy, their protectiveness of their Cavern. “I may be able to ask their aid, if I could take the medallion to them?”
Varian frowned, looking at the medallion in Shaw’s hand. “That amulet is our only chance.”
It was Shaw who came to Bryna’s side, both figuratively and literally. “We need to explore every possibility,” he told the King, as he stepped forward in front of her and Kamery, who still stood protectively near Carolyn. In a lower voice for only the two of them, he murmured, “I look forward to your report, about everything.”
The King’s face was unreadable, as his eyes scanned the group surrounding him. They fixed on Raynn, with her armor and shield. “Take your friends,” he instructed Bryna. “Do not lose it.” At Varian’s command, Shaw held the medallion out to Bryna.
She nodded, feeling the odd weight as he handed it to her. The gold and onyx themselves weren’t heavy, but the medallion, even broken as it was, dragged down on her hand. She quickly slipped it into an empty pocket in her backpack, well away from her other magical materials.
When Varian had mentioned friends, Raynn had stepped closer to them. She looked questioningly at Carolyn and Kamery now. Both sisters nodded, and Bryna took a few steps back to give herself room for the portal to Theramore. She hoped that Jaina wouldn’t mind their passing through on the way to Tanaris.</Text>

            <Title>Reunion of Three at Menethil Harbour</Title>
            <Synopsis>Carolyn and Kamery's investigation leads them to Menethil Harbour.  Elthas returns to the Eastern Kingdoms to look for his friends; he runs into Kamery and Carolyn almost immediately when he lands in Menethil Harbor.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Carolyn looked around the small town of Menethil Harbor, breathing in the pungent mix of salt and swamp, as memories washed over her. She had come through here a little over a year ago, eager and inexperienced, but determined to make it to Darnassus. The trip through the Wetlands had been harrowing. The Dwarves of Dun Algaz had told her to stay on the road, and hearing the sounds of the wildlife beyond, she had heartily agreed. Even then, she had had to outrun several raptors, and one particularly unpleasant-smelling sentient slime.
This time, she and Kamery had been able to hire gryphons from Ironforge. Flying over the soaring, snow-covered peaks of Dun Morogh had been breathtaking. A ship from Darnassus was currently approaching Menethil, and as they had circled in for landing she had watched it with nostalgia. She wondered briefly how Elthas was doing, and what new abilities had gotten him so excited, and yet uncharacteristically mysterious.
With one last wistful look at the docks and the nearing ship, she returned her attention to the matter at hand. From Duskwood, to Trias, to a scuffle with a gang of Stormwind thugs—Kamery had taken that one in stride so easily—and now to Menethil. The clues they were following seemed so tenuous, but they had no choice if they were to get to the bottom of this. DeLavey’s ominous warnings echoed in her mind, spurring her onwards.
“Trias said his man was a bartender,” Kamery remembered. “The inn perhaps?”
Carolyn nodded, looking around. She had spent so little time her last time, in her hurry to reach the Kaldorei homeland. The town was dominated by a large stone keep, its plain walls facing them on the harbor side; its entrance faced the town gates and the bridge to the Wetlands, she remembered. Between the keep and the town walls stood a row of similarly-constructed smaller buildings. Their blue-tiled roofs, dark wooden support beams, and white walls reminded her of Stormwind’s Trade District. Most were single-story shops, but a larger two-story building suggested that it might be the inn they sought.
With a gesture to Kamery, Carolyn started in that direction. Behind her, the harbor bell rang, indicating that the ship from Darnassus had docked. It would leave again later that afternoon, and remembering the papers that they had found in Duskwood, she quickened her step.
The larger building was indeed the inn and its interior was warm and welcoming as any in Stormwind’s territories, despite being so disconnected from the southern lands. Carolyn wondered if Dwarven inns were as hospitable, as she took in the fireplace crackling along one wall, the comfortable groupings of chairs and tables spread about the room, and the smiling bartender behind the bar at the back of the front room. She reflected that perhaps she should have taken the time to experience more on her wild rush to Darnassus, but she had been too eager.
There were only a few locals in the inn at this time, mostly sitting in chairs near the fire. A low murmur of voices drifted about the room. Kamery took the lead, striding directly over to the bar, where the bartender greeted them warmly, asking if they wanted any ale or mutton. From the kitchen behind him, the sizzle and enticing aroma of roasting meat emphasized the offer.
Shaking her head, Kamery leaned close and, keeping her voice low, asked, “Mikhail? Trias sent us.”
If anything, the man’s demeanor became even more welcoming. Smiling, he told them, “Anything you need, just ask. I will do my best to aid you.”
Kamery relayed their mission so far, and their single clue, the name ‘Slim.’
Mikhail shook his head apologetically. “Slim, you say? Not sure the name sounds familiar.” He broke off, his eyes darting to something behind them. Carolyn fought the urge to turn, even before he added, “Don’t look now, but the gentleman over by the exit is looking over here. He seems a little too interested in our conversation, if you catch my meaning?”
Kamery nodded, and Carolyn saw her sister’s eyes dart that way. From her position at the further end of the bar, Kamery had a better view of the room than Carolyn did. Did she plan it that way?
Her sister stiffened, with a muttered curse. “He’s getting away, come on.”
Turning, Carolyn saw that the suspicious man was indeed heading out the door, while still watching them closely. She followed Kamery in pursuit, as the man left the inn.
Back in the dusty roadway between the inn and the keep, Kamery stopped abruptly, looking in both directions. “He’s disappeared,” she groaned.
“Should we split up?” Carolyn asked. “He couldn’t have gotten far.”
With a nod, Kamery gestured for Carolyn to head south, towards the harbor, while she turned to jog north.
Carolyn didn’t get far. As she passed the gap between the inn and the shop next to it, two figures wearing familiar red bandannas leaped out at her. The glint of sharped steel flashed in the afternoon sunlight. Twisting her body to avoid one of the thrusting daggers, she cast a shield spell with a quick whispered word. The second dagger glanced off of the shield, as the first bandit regrouped for another attack. Adrenaline surged, and she knew that she was outmatched.
“Kam!” she yelled, and saw her sister turn around and start to run towards them, as the men worked to flank her from both sides.
Remembering Raynn’s skillful maneuvers, Carolyn sidestepped backwards, trying to keep both in front of her, and trying to keep them at bay with a swing of her staff. The moves took her further from her sprinting sister, but at least she wasn’t being stabbed in the back. Her staff made a dull thud, the sensation shuddering up her arms, as it connected solidly with one of the bandits, but the other ducked under her swing and came up leading with his dagger.
Carolyn’s shield shattered and she fell back again, scrambling to solidify her footing. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears. She only had to hang on until Kamery arrived, she reminded herself, preemptively casting her instant slow-heal.
Suddenly, a roar of bestial rage came from behind her, and a massive brown-furred figure charged past her to knock down the threatening bandit. A large paws, tipped with razor-sharp claws swung, tearing into the man’s leather tunic. Carolyn almost laughed with relief, as she caught sight of familiar curving runes dyed into the tan fur.
Kamery caught up to them then, deftly using the hilt of one dagger to knock out the bandit still staggering from Carolyn’s staff blow. Her eyes scanned Carolyn quickly, looking for injuries, before she turned to their savior.
“Elthas!” Surprise and joy and relief filled Kamery’s voice. “We need to question him,” she added quickly.
The bear growled menacingly at the now-prone bandit, then smoothly shifted into the more familiar panther as he sat back on his haunches. Carolyn laid a grateful hand on the soft black fur of his head and he purred softly. With her other hand, she distractedly tucked a loose strand of blond hair back into the twist at the back of her head.
Eyes wide, the bandit was instantly cooperative. “Yeah, I’m Slim. The Defias didn’t pay me enough to die for their cause.” He cast a distrustful look at Elthas. “They took the King.”
Slim’s words hung in the air, leaving the trio stunned. Kamery’s grey eyes were wide over her black bandanna and even Elthas, not a citizen of Stormwind, seemed more subdued than usual. 
Seeing their looks of shock, Slim reiterated, “Yeah, the King of Stormwind, not some lowly diplomat.” Now that he had started, his words spilled out almost faster than Carolyn could follow. “He was on his way to Theramore to meet with Lady Jaina Proudmoore—it was a big deal apparently, and a big secret.” This was so much more than she had expected when Thomas had first approached her in the Cathedral. Had DeLavey known?
Slim wasn’t done though. “But it’s not just the Defias that are involved; this is bigger than them.” As Carolyn tried to process Slim’s words, her mind reeled. Bigger than the Defias, whose influence obviously stretched so much further than they had first realized?
Finishing, Slim tried to exonerate himself. “My part was just to get their man on board the King’s ship while it was in the harbor. The guy’s name was Hendel.” Trying to gather her thoughts, Carolyn wondered what they could do now.
At Elthas’s soft growl, Slim averred, “That’s all I know, I swear!”
Carolyn’s thoughts whirled as she absorbed the weight of Slim’s words. The King had been kidnapped? By something even bigger than the Defias? And all they had to go on now was a single name? Her eyes met Kamery’s, seeing a reflection of her own uncertainty.
Taking advantage of their distraction, Slim scurried off between the buildings, leaving his friend lying in the dirt next to the inn. Ignoring the unconscious bandit, Kamery’s eyes refocused, as she slowly breathed, “This is big. We’d better tell Mikhail.”
Returning to the inn, they quietly told the bartender what Slim had revealed. Mikhail’s eyes widened, but he quickly schooled his features. Grimly, he laid out their next move. “You’ll have to follow the trail to Theramore; find this Hendel. The next ship should be leaving this afternoon. I’ll get word to Stormwind.”
Carolyn looked at Elthas. He must have just arrived from Darnassus, but he nodded as his golden eyes met hers, seemingly unconcerned with spending over a month crossing and recrossing the same ocean. At least Theramore was on the eastern side of Kalimdor, unlike Darnassus, which required sailing around the northern end of the continent. They should arrive in about two weeks.</Text>

            <Text>In the end, he sent her back to Mathias Shaw, to report what she had seen. After a night at the inn herself, followed by a quick flight to Stormwind, Kamery stood in Shaw’s office atop the SI:7 headquarters. A quick glance told her that not much had changed in the familiar round, wood-paneled room; the desk was currently cleared of papers, with just one blank sheet sitting near the quill and inkwell.
As was often his habit when entertaining visitors, the spy-master stood across from the desk, looking out of his open window. Morning sunlight filled the room, along with cool, crisp air from the nearby mountains. The sound of steel hitting wood rose from the training yard below, a muted percussion to her report. When she finished, Shaw half-turned to Kamery with an enigmatic smile.
“SI:7 can do much, but for this, I think it’s time to assemble a more well-rounded group,” he directed. Almost as an afterthought, he added, “Something that can’t be connected back to Stoutmantle.” Shaw gestured to the training yard below. “A sword and shield would be a good start.”
Through the open window, Kamery could see Raynn, her auburn ponytail swinging freely in rhythm with her movements. Kamery smiled, satisfied at being given a second chance with the warrior. Remembering their trouble with Hogger, she knew that the two of them wouldn’t be enough for whatever lay beyond that steel door below Moonbrook. A healer would be nice, but I’m not even sure where Caro is now; it would take too long to reach her.
Seeming to read her thoughts, Shaw continued, “Perhaps your sister would be willing to return to join you. Write to her; I’ll see it delivered.” He sounded so confident that Kamery complied readily. When she had finished a short note—Shaw had instructed her not to include any details—she left it with him.
Daring to hope that she might see Carolyn again soon, Kamery’s steps were lighter than usual as she walked down the spiraling stairs from the tower office. Although the Defias threat and the challenges ahead still lurked in her mind, she longed to hear even more details about her sister’s travels and the druid companion that the priestess had mentioned in her letters.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Carolyn and Elthas cross Shimmering Flats to the Raceway</Synopsis>
            <Text>Walking across the dry salt flat, Carolyn glanced up as shadows flickered across their path. A pair of gryphons swept by overhead, flying southwards. Curiously, she wondered where they were heading. Although she had become fairly familiar with northern Kalimdor, her knowledge had ended at the Stonetalon Mountains and Theramore. Their recent trip to Feathermoon Island had been much further south; she was still trying to fit the different parts together in her mind.
She did know that there was no salt flat along the route that they had thought they were taking towards Theramore. However, neither she nor Elthas had the temperament to turn back, so they had pressed on. Unfortunately, the distance had been deceiving, and the dark shape, which Elthas had thought might be a Goblin town, didn’t seem to be getting any closer.
Goblin or not, Carolyn hoped that whoever lived there would be more friendly than the Tauren that they had passed as they had wound their way through the massive stone pillars of Thousand Needles. At least those Tauren, unlike the ones in Feralas, hadn’t been hostile. They had just completely ignored her pleas for directions.
Under the midday sun, Carolyn had sent her moonsaber away. Elthas had also shifted out of form. Feline fur was just too hot for this land, not without water. Her skin only had a few mouthfuls left in it. She ran her tongue over her cracking lips, then immediately regretted it, at the salty taste.
Determination propelled her onwards, just concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other. In her focus, she almost missed the sounds growing from ahead.
“Sounds mechanical,” Elthas murmured, drawing her attention to the rattles and clanks. Looking up, she realized that they had indeed drawn closer. The sound triggered a memory, of the oversized reaper in the Deadmines. Pushing aside the misgivings that the thought brought, she focused instead on the fond memories of the small group that Kamery had put together for that foray.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Mana break
- Sneaky ones return with info</Synopsis>
            <Text>Back in the antechamber leading into the large central cavern, Carolyn cast another holy spell with a sigh. King or not, Varian was drawing her ire; he was reckless in combat, and didn’t even have a shield as Raynn did. The auburn-haired warrior was doing her best to draw the attention of their enemies, but Varian, and Broll, were aggressive fighters. At least Broll’s bear hide was thick enough to blunt most of the damage that came his way.
“Enough,” Carolyn took advantage of a break in the combat, stopping the group before they charged into the central cavern. Surely Kamery and Elthas would be back soon to report their findings. The priestess most certainly did not want to take on the entire population of the Dark Iron city.
Luckily, Varian and Broll were solicitous enough of her role to stop immediately. Raynn looked at Carolyn with amused understanding; she knew the priestess’s endurance well enough to know that this rest wasn’t required.
Bryna, however, took advantage of the moment, conjuring a magical refreshment for herself and settling down on a nearby rock to drink. She offered some to Carolyn, who accepted for appearances’ sake.
His face creased with concern, Varian looked down at her. “Will you be able to keep up?” he asked her, frowning.
Carolyn frowned back. As she grew accustomed to the King’s presence, her healer sensibilities came to the forefront. “I will if you stop charging in and taking so many blows. Let Raynn’s shield absorb them.”
The King looked taken aback by her censure, but also a little chagrined. “We must find Windsor,” he insisted.
“Already done.” Kamery emerged from the shadows of the connecting corridor behind Raynn, startling both warriors.
“Where is he?” Varian demanded, looking around as he recovered from his surprise.
Kamery shook her head. “He says they took his weapon and destroyed his notes. He’s”—she hesitated—“he’s lost all hope. He wouldn’t come with me.”
Varian slumped, his face falling. “We needed Windsor’s research to counter the Black Dragonflight. If his notes are lost, we have no chance to reveal the impostors.”
“They may not be lost.” Elthas spoke as he shifted out of feline form, approaching from the side. From his pack, he retrieved a stained, crumpled piece of paper. “I found this.” He gestured vaguely towards the tunnels beyond the grate.
Varian started to reach out for the note, but a light touch on his arm from Broll stopped him.
“Well done, young one.” the elder druid smiled. “What does it say?”
Carolyn smiled to herself as she stood. She knew that Broll had been somewhat critical of Elthas earlier, and it was good to hear the compliment.
Elthas frowned at the paper. “I can only make out a few words,” he admitted, “but it speaks of Windsor’s research. It seems as though the Dark Irons are working on decrypting them. Two names are mentioned, General Angerforge and Argelmach.”
Varian turned back towards the large chamber. “We must retrieve the information from them then.”
“We have no idea where they are,” Bryna pointed out. The mage was still sitting on her rock, looking more like she was on a picnic than a military operation. The brim of her red hat tilted as she glanced at Carolyn with a raised eyebrow.
Carolyn understood, even as her chest tightened at the idea. They needed direction though, or Varian would likely bring the wrath of the entire Dark Iron clan on them.
“Let’s find out then,” she said softly. “Wait here.”
Understanding immediately, Kamery came to her side. “You don’t have to do this.” The rogue’s eyes crinkled. “I could ask them nicely.”
Carolyn laughed. “All right, you try first then.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Bryna and Elthas go to Lakeshire
- Solomon sends them to Stormwind
- Bryna goes alone, sans hat to keep a low profile
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Elthas watched the Kaldorei walk away with interest. Helendis seemed to be some sort of warrior, although not quite as much of one as Raynn, or a Sentinel. He was certainly frazzled, and Elthas couldn’t blame him. This blasted land was completely devoid of life, and the constant odor of ash and fire assaulted their senses.
The druid was glad that he had begun to adjust to towering over his Human friends, as the feline form was far too sensitive to stay in for long. He longed for green grass, and preferably some trees. While the presence of his friends made such lifeless landscapes tolerable, he was much more comfortable when surrounded by growing things.
Bryna was turning the letter over in her hands, examining it; she seemed disappointed that it was securely sealed. “I’ll run errands while you go stab things.” The mage grinned at Kamery from under the wide, floppy brim of her red hat.
The rogue considered for a moment. “The road will be dangerous. The Blackrock have encroached on Redridge already.”
Although Elthas had never been to Redridge, he decided that it must have some sort of vegetation. “I’ll go with you,” he quickly offered and Bryna accepted gratefully. Kamery looked mollified and she followed Raynn and Carolyn out of the small encampment.
“Sorry I won’t be much conversation,” Elthas apologized, shifting into his cheetah form. His whiskers twitched at the pervasive singed scent in the air.
Bryna smiled at the druid. “It’ll be good to have company either way.” Pulling her enchanted carpet from her bag, she unfurled it and hopped on. A shift of her weight, and the rug accelerated down the slope after the swift cheetah.
As the magical carpet effortlessly kept pace with his cheetah, the black ash gave way to warm brown soil. As patches of low grass began to spring up along the way, Elthas breathed deeply, reveling in once more being surrounded by life. Sparse trees, accompanied by the cheerful chirping of birds, dotted the roadside as they approached the Human village.
With its white walls, criss-crossing dark wood supports, and clay tile roofs, Lakeshire epitomized the Human architectural style. The hamlet was build on the shores of a long, narrow lake, the glistening waters of which beckoned to Elthas.
Business came first though, and they made their way to the town hall. Magistrate Solomon was grim when he read the message, telling them that Lakeshire’s forces were already spread too thin.
“You must take this information to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind at once! If he does not send the aid of Stormwind, then all is lost,” Solomon declared, sending them away.
Moving back outside, they found a quiet corner beside the town hall in Lakeshire to discuss their next move.
“We’re supposed to avoid Stormwind,” Elthas frowned, his long features lengthening even more. “We have no choice though, we need to seek their aid.”
“Shaw won’t like it.” Bryna shrugged, her mind already decided. “But not we. I’ll go. There are too few Kaldorei in Stormwind; you’ll stand out too much.”
Her statement made Elthas laugh, as he gestured to her bright red hat.
With a light snort, Bryna pulled the hat off her head and slipped it into her bag, pulling out a simple robe instead. Pulling the robe on over her head, she then gathered her hair and tied it in a low ponytail at the nape of her neck.
Reaching into her bag again, Bryna pulled out a simple magic wand and affixed it to her belt. A quick illusion spell transformed the features of her face and turned her hair a mousy brown. Now, she looked like any one of a dozen adventuresome mages who might deliver such a message.
Elthas watched, wide-eyed at the transformation. She was practically druidic in this ability. He nodded his approval and watched as Bryna pulled the teleportation energies around herself, breaking Shaw’s orders.</Text>

            <Title>Northwatch Goodbyes - Thrall</Title>
            <Synopsis>Raynn, Thrall, and Jaina meet overlooking Northwatch Hold. Thrall and Jaina encourage Raynn to travel to Stormwind.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Thrall stood atop the hill overlooking the abandoned Northwatch Hold, his gaze drawn to the silent remnants of a conflict that echoed through the land. By his side, Jaina Proudmoore shared the weight of the past, her eyes thoughtful as they surveyed the forsaken fortress.
Raynn stood nearby, her presence a blend of resilience and weariness. Thrall pondered the young warrior's future, her place in a world still wrestling with the shadows of war. The potential of what Raynn could become lingered in his mind, an unspoken burden that shaped his concern.
&quot;Raynn,&quot; Thrall began, his voice reflecting the weight of experience, &quot;Kalimdor has been a crucible of trials. Your journey has been one of both strength and sacrifice.&quot;
Jaina, her expression contemplative, nodded in agreement. &quot;The land bears the scars of our choices, but it also holds the potential for healing.&quot;
Thrall turned to Raynn, his gaze steady despite the turmoil of his thoughts. He tried to choose his words carefully, to not give away too much. &quot;I've glimpsed the potential within you, a path unbound by the conflicts that have shaped our past. There are lands beyond Kalimdor, places where you can discover more about your heritage.&quot;
Jaina interjected, her tone empathetic. &quot;Stormwind has risen from the ashes, a city rebuilding its identity. Your father's legacy is there, waiting to be explored.&quot;
Raynn absorbed their words, a silent contemplation in her gaze. Thrall, burdened by the knowledge of what might come, hoped that she would heed the guidance, forging a path toward understanding and unity.
The trio stood atop the hill, a tableau of uncertainty and hope, as Kalimdor whispered its tales of war and the potential for a different future.

            <Synopsis>- Kamery has flashback to:
 - Varian mounts Onyxia's head on the gates
 - Kamery and Shaw talk</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kamery noticed the King’s smile, and felt her own lips curve upwards beneath her bandanna as her sister’s face softened momentarily. During their earlier ventures, she knew that Carolyn and Varian had grown close. Despite his impatience and recklessness, the King had been solicitous of the overworked healer. Kamery knew that Carolyn had also made an impression on him, as the rogue remembered her conversation with Shaw shortly after Onyxia’s death.
 Stormwind rejoiced, as the Black Dragon brood-mother’s head was mounted above the city gates—a trophy, and a warning to those who would threaten the Kingdom. Kamery and Carolyn were among those watching, as King Varian gave a rousing speech, celebrating those who had endured, commemorating those who hadn’t, and promising a brighter future for his people.
Raynn, Bryna, and Elthas were also with them. Elthas, not wanting to stand out with his height, was once more in feline form; Bryna, less concerned, wore her usual bright red hat. Raynn stood tall and straight in her armor, but she was relaxed and smiling, even with Shaw standing nearby.
As the ceremony drew to a close and people began to disperse, Shaw beckoned Kamery to follow him back to SI:7 headquarters. Nodding goodbye to her friends, she followed. This conversation, she knew, was long overdue. Their preoccupation with Onyxia had overshadowed their recent meetings, and she had yet to give him a full report on the months since he had sent her to Tanaris with orders to find the others.
The streets were bustling and noisy with speculation and rumors about the dragon’s influence and death, but they made their way in silence, and soon reached Shaw’s office at the top of the SI:7 headquarters in Old Town. Tossing his cloak aside, Shaw took his usual post by the window, looking out across the sunlit, white stone city as Kamery waited in patient silence.
“Every time”—the spy-master turned to her with a warm smile—“you and your friends surprise me.”
Kamery’s answering smile was guarded, waiting for the questions that she knew she couldn’t answer—not from ignorance, but unwillingness to betray her friends’ trust. She also waited, dreaded, a new assignment that pull her away from those friends.
Shaw surprised her though. “What the five of you have become, it’s more than a mission.” He gave a self-deprecating smile. “I think it always was, although neither of us saw it at first.”
Looking back out of the window, Shaw continued, “Kamery, you have been a valuable agent to SI:7. Your group however, is far more valuable to Stormwind. We, Varian and I, would like you to continue to use your combined abilities to serve the greater good of the Kingdom.”
Kamery’s eyes widened, absorbing the compliments, and the implications. “I can’t speak for all of us…”
“Of course. Consult with the others, and let us know. If you accept, you will be given a Royal Commission, although practically speaking, you will likely still be reporting to me most of the time.” He gave a satisfied smile, and Kamery suspected that he had planted that idea in the King’s mind himself; Shaw did like to be involved in everything.
Kamery nodded. “I’ll ask the others.” She glanced over at the stairs, then back at Shaw, wondering if he wanted anything more.
“You, all of you, impressed the King, not only with your skills and abilities, but your confidence and solidarity.” Turning back to Kamery, Shaw chuckled in recollection. “Apparently, your sister made quite an impact on him; something about Northshire priests being quite unlike those of the Cathedral.”
Kamery laughed. “She suggested that he should acquire a shield.”
With an appreciative grin, Shaw gave a nod of dismissal, sending her to discuss the future with her friends. She found them waiting outside, at the base of the wall surrounding the lawn, where they were out of sight of Shaw’s window. Bryna’s smirk told her that the position hadn’t been accidental.
“Is this goodbye again?” The mage got right to the point. The others, even Raynn, looked concerned at the prospect. Kamery was glad to be able to reassure them; without hesitation, they all agreed to Shaw’s proposal.
Among other endeavors, they had been tasked with aiding the Dwarves of Ironforge in combating the threat of the Dark Iron Dwarves. The influence of Ragnaros was spreading throughout the region, and now, it was time to end that threat once and for all.</Text>
            <Notes>Kamery doesn’t tell Shaw everything; he knows it, but accepts that the bonds of the group are stronger than her job.</Notes>

            <Title>Shadows and Light</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Carolyn manipulates the Shadows of Onyxia's spell, using it to reunite Varian.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Onyxia’s redirection had momentarily lightened Carolyn’s healing burden, and she watched with horrified fascination as the dark spell wove around the two Varians. While she wasn’t versed in draconic magic, this, she realized, she recognized, at least in part. The magic was formed from Shadows, and she was familiar with their insidious tendrils.
Forcing herself to focus, she studied those tendrils now. They were pulling at the two men, while at the same time binding them together. If she could leverage those bindings, while countering the destructive force, perhaps…
Carolyn frowned in concentration as she whispered a prayer to the Light. She refused to hope, not yet. This was too unfamiliar, too untested. The holy magic infiltrated the Shadows, changing their shape.
The noise of the ongoing battle faded to Carolyn’s senses, as her focus narrowed to just the shape of those Shadows. Binding, and now, healing. Within the embrace of the Shadow, two men became one. She whispered another holy word, bathing him in healing Light.
Even as she finally allowed herself to believe, to feel satisfaction in her spell-casting, a heavy blow knocked her to the ground. Onyxia, seeing her spell disrupted, had turned her ire on the priestess. With Raynn’s shield removed from the way, Carolyn had been vulnerable. A smile played on her lips as she fell though, seeing Varian, one Varian, bringing his sword down on Onyxia’s scaled hide.</Text>

            <Title>Ragged John</Title>
            <Synopsis>- arrive back at Morgan's Vigil
- Maxwell is overwhelmed
- Maxwell says Ragged John might help
- Varian talks to John
- Maxwell shows Kamery the situation in the Steppes
- Broll tells Raynn and Caro Lo'Gosh's story</Synopsis>
            <Text>As they reached the rough palisade surrounding Morgan’s Vigil, Varian took the lead, his purposeful strides taking him swiftly through the outpost. The Marshal stood near the base of the crumbling ruins of the tower at the back. The sisters dropped back to flank Raynn as they followed, also wanting to introduce themselves to the commander. Broll paused in the middle of the ruined town to look around at the centuries-old destruction before also following.
The Marshal looked up, blinking twice at the diverse group that approached, Varian in the lead, while the others waited a few steps away. “Greetings. I am Marshal Maxwell. What brings you here?”
The man was dressed in the full armor of Stormwind, although he had removed his helm. Brown hair reached his shoulders, matching his full mustache and beard. He looked rather overwhelmed, and Raynn wondered if he even recognized the King whose crest he wore.
“Where is Marshal Windsor?” Varian was certainly direct, Raynn realized. She thought back to Magni’s words. ‘A good man.’ The Dwarven king had said, and thinking fondly of the gruff Dwarf, she could see how he would think so. It was a refreshing change from the stiff formality she had felt from the other nobles on her brief visit to the throne room of Stormwind.
Marshall Maxwell blinked again, a flicker of recognition passing through his eyes. “We don’t know,” he admitted, sounding mystified. “I was only just assigned here,” he explained. “Ragged John knows more, if you can get anything out of him.”
The Marshal gestured to a Dwarf sitting on a barrel behind one of the ruined buildings. The Dwarf held a brown leather flask, and as they watched, he took a long drink from it.
Varian’s eyes narrowed, but he nodded his thanks to Maxwell and strode over to the Dwarf.
“Was that…?” Maxwell trailed off, then seemed to regroup, turning to Raynn as she and her friends approached. “You’re Riverhorn’s help?”
Raynn nodded. “We’ve bought you some room, although it may not last long.”
“Good, good. Perhaps you could stay a while?” Maxwell looked at them hopefully.
“We’re not sure why we’re here,” Kamery broke in. “What is the situation?”
Maxwell sighed. “I’m still trying to figure that out myself.” He beckoned the rogue over to a nearby map table.
Satisfied to let Kamery deal with the strategization, Raynn returned her attention to Varian. Across the ruined town, the King was deep in conversation with the Dwarf. Although she was well aware of the capacity of Dwarves to hold their alcohol, Raynn suspected that this particular one had reached his limit. Varian looked frustrated.
“He’s not what I would have expected,” Carolyn said softly at Raynn’s side.
“He’s been through a lot,” Broll told her. The druid had stayed back, well away from Ragged John. “He washed up on the shores of Durotar with no memory, and was immediately captured by an Orc gladiator master. He was paired with Valeera and me. We fought well together.” He smiled faintly at the memories.
“But Lo’Gosh, as they called him then, began to regain his memories,” Broll continued. “With the aid of Jaina Proudmoore, he remembered that he was Varian Wrynn, King of Stormwind, and he was determined to reclaim his throne.”
As she listened to Broll’s tale, Raynn continued to watch Varian. She had seen the Orcish influence in his armor and his fighting style, and now it made sense. He seemed to have met his match in Ragged John, however. Their conversation, although still inaudible, was growing more and more animated. Frustration creased Varian’s face as his hand moved in an emphatic gesture.
Broll continued, “We traveled to Menethil, and through to Ironforge. There, King Magni told us of his investigations, and Windsor’s suspicions. We were set upon by a black dragon assassin, and Valeera—” He broke off, pausing for a moment before continuing.
“Valeera remains in Ironforge recovering. Windsor should have been here.” Broll frowned over at Marshal Maxwell, there in Windsor’s place.
A moment later, Varian seemed to feel that he had learned all he could from Ragged John. Clenching his fists in front of him, he turned on his heel and strode back. Passing the three of them, he approached Maxwell once more. Sharing a glance, the three moved closer to hear the conversation.</Text>

            <Notes>Has Marshal Maxwell heard about King Varian’s return? How does he handle the ‘King’ showing up? - He’s pretty new, flustered and overwhelmed. He doesn’t really question it.
- Anduin has told Magni that feels something is “amiss” about his father, but can’t say what (Varian heard second-hand from Magni)
- Anduin has requested further investigation into his father’s abduction; Varian agreed, but Prestor intercepted and had him assign one of her own agents rather than SI:7 (unknown to anyone here)
- Magni has enlisted the aid of Marshal Windsor; Windsor has concluded that the Varian in Stormwind may be a dragon impostor
- Magni has told this to Varian/Broll/Valeera; not wanting to endanger Anduin by a premature confrontation, they seek out Windsor themselves
- As they are leaving Ironforge, a black dragon agent attacks Varian; Valeera subdues him, but succumbs to demonic influence/magic withdrawal/whatever
- Varian and Broll continue to Burning Steppes, where Windsor was last reported to have been</Notes>

            <Title>25-10-45-The Band Gets Back Together</Title>
            <Text>As Carolyn and Elthas assisted in repelling the Naga incursions at Feathermoon Stronghold, their sense of adventure was only fueled further. Whispers of powerful magic and ancient lore in the Ogre stronghold of Dire Maul reached their ears, but caution prevailed, and they deemed themselves not yet ready for such a challenge.

Guided by Elthas's restless spirit, they journeyed eastward, exploring the vast landscapes of Thousand Needles and beyond. Their travels eventually led them to the bustling town of Gadgetzan, where they were pleasantly surprised to find Raynn and Bryna.

Raynn, having nearly completed her blacksmithing training, greeted them warmly. &quot;Well met! I've been honing my skills in Tanaris. How have your adventures been?&quot;

Elthas chuckled. &quot;We've been exploring the wilds, encountering everything from curious wildlife to the occasional harrowing foe.&quot;

Bryna, with her knack for finding excitement, joined the conversation. &quot;And I've become a bit of a local expert on Zul'Farrak. Those trolls really know how to throw a party!&quot;

Kamery, having strategically neutralized the Dark Iron threat in the Badlands, received a message from Mathias Shaw advising her to sharpen her skills further before delving into the Searing Gorge. The seasoned rogue suggested she rejoin her sister and friends in Tanaris, and perhaps venture into the mysterious Un'Goro Crater.

Upon Kamery's arrival, the group shared tales of their respective adventures, forming a dynamic ensemble of skills and experiences. The prospect of exploring Un'Goro Crater together loomed on the horizon, promising new challenges and discoveries for this eclectic group of adventurers.

---

In the dimly lit confines of SI:7 headquarters, Kamery entered Mathias Shaw's office, her presence emanating a blend of confidence and stealth. The seasoned rogue looked up from his maps, acknowledging her entrance with a nod.

&quot;Kamery, good to see you. I trust your mission in the Badlands went smoothly?&quot; Shaw's sharp gaze met hers.

Kamery inclined her head. &quot;Indeed, it did. The Dark Iron leadership is in disarray, at least for now. I managed to eliminate their leader, causing enough chaos to disrupt their plans.&quot;

Shaw nodded in approval. &quot;Good work, Kamery. You've proven your skills once again. The Dark Irons won't be causing us trouble for a while.&quot;

Kamery's expression remained impassive. &quot;I'm glad to have been of service, Shaw. What's the next move?&quot;

Shaw leaned back, steepling his fingers. &quot;Your work has been impressive, but I want you to hone your skills further before delving deeper into the Dark Iron territory. There are whispers of trouble in the Searing Gorge, and I believe you should be more prepared for what you might find there.&quot;

Kamery listened intently, her mind already calculating the possibilities. &quot;Understood. I'll continue to sharpen my skills. Any specific areas I should focus on?&quot;

Shaw paused, considering. &quot;Stealth and subtlety will be crucial. Work on refining your ability to infiltrate and observe without detection. We may need you to gather intel in more sensitive locations.&quot;

Kamery's eyes gleamed with determination. &quot;Consider it done. I'll be ready for whatever lies ahead.&quot;

Shaw offered a rare smile. &quot;I have no doubt. In the meantime, I've received word that your sister and her companions are in Tanaris. Join them, strengthen your bonds, and explore the mysteries of Un'Goro Crater. It'll be good for you.&quot;

Kamery nodded, appreciative of the guidance. &quot;Thank you, Shaw. I'll keep you updated on my progress.&quot;

As Kamery left Shaw's office, she felt a sense of purpose. The challenges ahead were formidable, but with the support of her sister and their eclectic group of friends, she knew she could face whatever awaited them in the ever-unfolding tapestry of Azeroth.</Text>

Perched on the edge of the North Atlantic Ocean, Peggy’s Cove is an idyllic fishing village turned tourist attraction. From the rugged granite shoreline to the iconic lighthouse, from the Sou’wester Gift Shop and Restaurant to the local artisans, the village offers a plethora of Maritime Canadian riches.
Peggy’s Cove is built on a massive outcropping of granite that extends into the chilly grey-blue waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The stone is speckled grey, flecked with white and black, and stretches in a wide swath along the shoreline. Tourist-filled pathways criss-cross the rocks closer to the parking lot, but beyond the well-traveled routes, quietude awaits, overlooking the wild ocean.
Sheets of bedrock are split by deep crevices, and massive boulders have been left tumbled about by ancient glaciers. The air is filled with the crash and rush of the ocean as it batters the rocky shore. Salt spray glitters like diamonds in the sunlight, filling the nose with its sharp, briny scent. At the waterline, the rock is dark with slick, slimy seaweed.
Perhaps the most recognizable feature of Peggy’s Cove is the white and red lighthouse. The octagonal base of the tower is painted white, while the upper structure, which houses the light, is a vibrant red. Across the parking lot from the lighthouse stands the Sou’wester Gift Shop and Restaurant, which serves hearty lunches of seafood chowder and fish cakes, along with selling a variety of souvenirs to tourists.
Further down the road, into the heart of the tiny village, the way is lined with the smaller shops and workshops of local artisans. Brightly colored wooded buildings are home to painters, metalworkers, and glass blowers.
Whether seeking a deeper connection to nature, a hearty meal, or a one-of-a-kind memento to display at home, visitors to Peggy’s Cove are sure to find fulfillment. The tiny fishing village is a delightful Maritime treasure.

            <Title>Evolving Plot</Title>
            <Text>In more detail:
- This is an adventure story, following five players characters in the World of Warcraft.
Part 1
Kamery is a rogue in the employ of SI:7. She had been investigating the Defias Brotherhood in Westfall, and has discovered their main base of operations. She is tasked with putting together a group to clear it out, and bring their leader to justice. She recruits her sister, Carolyn, and Raynn, a warrior/blacksmith whom she had met earlier. Carolyn has been adventuring on another continent, but she happily returns at her sister’s request; Carolyn is accompanied by her friend Elthas, and a mage Bryna, whom Elthas had impulsively asked to join them. At this point, the leader of the Defias is the main goal.
Character motivations in part 1:
Kamery - Doing her job, she has seen what the Defias have done to the people of Westfall, and wants to bring them to justice.
Carolyn - She wants to help her sister, and is also motivated by justice.
Elthas - He is excited to explore a new land, with new friends, and help Carolyn and Kamery.
Bryna - She is often restless and had been getting bored anyway, so this is a fun new adventure. She enjoys the camaraderie of the group and sees potential for their future.
Raynn - She had heard of the Defias, and is happy to help bring them to justice. She also has a strong desire to improve her blacksmithing, but sets it aside to help Kamery. (In the words of her trainer: “The gauntlets will be here when you return. But if you don’t go, Kamery might not return.”)

Part 2
After killing the leader of the Defias (when he wouldn’t surrender), the group returns to Stormwind and almost immediately discovers that the Defias still have agents within the city. They investigate further, and assassinate a corrupt noble and several Defias.
Character motivations in part 2:
All - finishing what they started, still trying to stop the Defias from threatening the general populace.

Part 3
Carolyn, a priestess, is asked, by a bishop, to investigate a missing diplomat, and Kamery joins her. They are told that the Defias are involved, but learn that the Defias actually answer to someone even more powerful. Elthas returns to Darnassus to train, but then reunites with the sisters in Menethil Harbor and joins their investigation. They learn that the missing “diplomat” is King Varian Wrynn. Bryna studies with Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore for a while, but then rejoins the others when their investigation brings them to Theramore. Their investigation hits a dead end, but they discover hints that the Black Dragonflight is involved with the Defias. They learn that the King has returned to Stormwind, but with no memory of his abduction. Meanwhile, Raynn travels to Stranglethorn Vale to learn more about blacksmithing.
Character motivations in part 3:
Carolyn - Doing a task for a leader in her organization, and continuing to unravel the Defias influence.
Kamery - Helping her sister (which is her next assignment for SI:7 too), and continuing to oppose the Defias.
Elthas - Goes to Darnassus because he has discovered that he had learn a new form to show Carolyn (she is fascinated by his shapeshifting). Returns through Menethil Harbor because that’s the route back to Stormwind and his friends - it’s a happy coincidence that they meet in Menethil Harbor. Joins them for friendship and to stop the Defias.
Bryna - Goes to Theramore to study. Rejoins the others because she’s bored with books (again). Bryna does have a sense of justice too, but mostly she’s just motivated by seeking novelty.
Raynn - Wants to improve her blacksmithing. Her late father taught her blacksmithing—she enjoys the craft, and wants to make him proud.

Part 4
After the dead end in their investigation, the characters are at loose ends. Carolyn, Kamery, Bryna, and Elthas continue to adventure together for a while, doing small tasks to help people in the Wetlands. They separate when Kamery is recalled to SI:7 for a solo assignment, taking out a fire elemental that is controlling Dark Iron Dwarven expansion. Elthas and Carolyn return to Darnassus, and then travel to Feathermoon Island. Bryna teleports around the world doing research on magically induced memory loss, a possible clue from the investigation, but gets nowhere.  Raynn continues to train with legendary blacksmithing masters, and is sent to Tanaris. Raynn decides to visit Theramore on her way to Tanaris, and meets Bryna, who joins her for the trip. While exploring Tanaris, Bryna discovers the Caverns of Time and fixes a time-way for the Bronze Dragonflight. Carolyn and Elthas cross Kalimdor and end up in Gadgetzan in Tanaris. After her solo mission, Kamery is sent to Tanaris to find her sister and friends, to rebuilt the group and get more experience together. After they all reunite in Tanaris, the group fixes another time-way for the Bronze Dragonflight, then travel to Un’goro Crater for some adventuring and bonding.
Character motivations in part 4:
Raynn - Improving her blacksmithing. Starting to heal emotionally from the loss of her parents when she was young, and enjoys the friendship of the group.
Carolyn and Elthas - Wanting to help people, both in the Wetlands and Feathermoon. Cross Kalimdor for exploration and adventure.
Carolyn - Returns to Darnassus to fulfill a childhood goal of learning to ride a Kaldorei moonsaber.
Elthas - Returns to Darnassus to learn a new form.
Bryna - Restless and seeking knowledge.
Kamery - Doing her job (which she took because she’s good at stealth, and wants to use it in service to her kingdom and justice). Dark Iron expansion threatens the stability of the continent.

Part 5
The five main characters are sent to the Burning Steppes with a vague directive. They learn that the Black Dragonflight has been influencing the Blackrock Orcs to be more aggressive. They encounter King Varian Wrynn and Broll Bearmantle, and join them in rescuing Marshal Reginald Windsor from the Dark Iron Dwarves in Blackrock Depths. They learn that Lady Katrana Prestor, a royal advisor in Stormwind, is actually the black dragon, Onyxia. They learn that Varian has been split into two people by Onyxia, who is currently controlling one of them on the throne of Stormwind. They travel to Stormwind and confront Onyxia. During the battle, the two copies of Varian are reunited into one. Facing unfavorable odds, Onyxia retreats. The main characters are tasked with figuring out how to access her lair. They consult with other dragon-flights, and Haleh sends them to Blackrock Spire, where they fight Orcs and a black dragonspawn. Haleh fixes the medallion that will give them access to Onyxia’s lair and they go in and kill her, ending the threat of the Black Dragonflight.
Character motivations in part 5:
All - to help Varian and counter the Black Dragonflight. Carolyn, Kamery, Bryna all grew up in Stormwind and respect the authority of the King. Raynn and Elthas less-so, but both see the justness of his cause, and at this point the group is pretty solidified, so they won’t leave their friends.

Epilogue
Varian leads an army into the Molten Core and they defeat Ragnaros, the elemental lord, ending the threat of the fire elementals. Without Ragnaros to control them, the Dark Iron Dwarves will eventually be reintegrated into Dwarven society, ending that threat.</Text>

&quot;Sire, I believe these people may be of some assistance to you. They have some experience against the black dragonflight.&quot; Marshal Maxwell bowed in apology for the intrusion on Varian and Broll's quiet discussion.

Varian looked over, a hint of wariness in his eyes, to see four young women and a large black panther.

Varian raised an eyebrow at Maxwell's judgment, but he and Broll needed whatever help they could get.

&quot;I'm Kamery, your majesty.&quot; The lithe woman in black rogue's leathers gave a slight bow, her dark eyes wide and observant above a black bandana. &quot;This is my sister, Carolyn.&quot; She gestured to a woman who shared her face, but was otherwise her opposite in every way, with white robes and golden hair.  The respectful bow was repeated, and Varian found himself inwardly grimacing. Maxwell had been the same way, although he had managed to loosen up a little over the past two days. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught the flash of amusement in Broll's eyes. He remembered once being accustomed to such obsequiences, but those days seemed long gone, replaced by the immediacy of everyday survival.

&quot;I'm Bryna.&quot; The voice came from the depths of a wide-brimmed red hat, which almost concealed the face beneath. The woman wore a vest and short pants that seemed almost laughably out of place in this place of fire and brimstone. At least she didn't bow; that would have required her to straighten from her lounging position against the half-wall surrounding their planning area. &quot;This is Elthas.&quot; She gestured to the panther who had been prowling around the perimeter of the area, but now sat motionless, studying Varian with golden eyes.

The fourth woman, a warrior in full plate armor, gave a respectful nod. &quot;Raynn,&quot; she introduced herself. &quot;What is it we'll be helping with?&quot;

Varian appreciated the directness, and returned his attention to their plans. &quot;We need to determine the extent of the black dragon influence. Our best hope is to find the missing Marshall Windsor.  Our source was somewhat incoherent, but he did mention the Blackrock Depths.  Perhaps Windsor can be found there.  We can't risk drawing too much attention though.&quot;

Suddenly the panther shifted, seamlessly transforming into a young Kaldorei man. &quot;I understand the scents now! This is the one that went over the cliff.&quot;

Varian looked at Broll, but found the other druid equally confused, as Elthas shifted back into his feline form, prowling around Varian.  Broll cleared his throat, and the panther stopped abruptly, his head tilting again.

Elthas's elven voice came easily from the panther's throat, &quot;you were held on Alcaz Island, weren't you.&quot; It wasn't really a question, but Varian nodded anyway. &quot;A while back, we were sent to investigate a prisoner there. We didn't know it was you,&quot; the druid added quickly, almost apologetically. &quot;The scents were confusing. Split. You're...&quot; he trailed off, but Varian's memories filled in the rest.

&quot;Half.&quot; Even the lackadaisical mage straighted slightly at the flattly-spoken word. Varian shook his head. &quot;I don't know what happened to the other half. My memory.. has gaps.&quot;

Kamery brought them back on task.  &quot;All the more important to find Windsor and learn what he knows then. Blackrock Depths it is.&quot;

&quot;The Dark Irons won't be easy foes.&quot; Broll spoke up.

&quot;We've faced them before. We can handle it.&quot; Elthas purred.

Raynn nodded agreement, her easy stance in heavy armor testament to her ability as a warrior. Motes of golden light swirled briefly around Carolyn as she cast a quick spell to bolster the group. Even Bryna gave a lazy smirk of agreement from beneath the brim of her wide hat.

Their confidence was reassuring to the weary king, and he gave a tight smile of gratitude.

---

In the labyrinthine tunnels of Blackrock Depths, the group moved with purpose, guided by Kamery's skillful lock-picking as they sought Marshal Windsor. The echoing footsteps resonated in the dimly lit passages, and the distant clinks of chains and groans of tortured prisoners added an unsettling ambiance.

Kamery's nimble fingers worked the lock on the cell doors until, with a satisfying click, one swung open to reveal the despondent figure of Marshal Windsor. His eyes, once filled with determination, now held a shadow of despair. The group assured him that they were here to help, but Windsor's spirits remained low.

&quot;I've lost everything,&quot; he confessed, &quot;my notes and Ironfoe, my cherished weapon.&quot;

Determined to restore Windsor's hope, the group left him temporarily in the cell and continued their exploration of Blackrock Depths. Along the way, they encountered the spectral echoes of long-dead dwarves, their wisps offering guidance and secrets. One spirit, in particular, imparted knowledge to Raynn, revealing the magical art of smelting dark iron ore, a material resistant to the ravages of fire.

As they navigated the dangerous city, attempting to avoid confrontation, they found themselves drawn into skirmishes with Dark Iron defenders. Despite their best efforts, the city proved well-defended, forcing the group to face the Dark Iron generals directly.

Through strategic battles and cunning tactics, they overcame the generals, retrieving Windsor's lost weapon and, most importantly, his precious notes. With newfound determination, they returned to the Marshall's cell, where the gleam in his eyes returned. Windsor, armed with Ironfoe once more, joined the group as they made their harrowing escape from the depths.

Emerging back into the open air of the Burning Steppes, they returned to Morgan's Vigil, where they poured over Windsor's gathered information. The documents revealed the extent of the black dragon influence and hinted at deeper plots yet to unfold. The group, now strengthened by their shared experiences in Blackrock Depths, prepared for the challenges that lay ahead, united in their quest to uncover the truth and confront the looming threat.

---

The message from Mathias Shaw arrived with an air of urgency, and Kamery relayed the contents to the group gathered at Morgan's Vigil. Varian Wrynn, now accompanied by Broll, shared his concern for the safety of his son, Anduin, and expressed the need to confront the black dragon Onyxia, revealed to be none other than Katrana Prestor.

&quot;Meeting with Shaw might give us insights into the current state of Stormwind,&quot; Kamery explained, her gaze shifting between the members of the group. &quot;We might find allies within SI:7, and it would be wise to assess the situation before taking any decisive action.&quot;

Varian nodded in agreement. &quot;I need to ensure my son's safety. But we can't rush in blindly. Let's go.&quot;

The group, now including Varian, made their way towards the familiar landscapes of Elwynn Forest. The cottage, once a warm haven in the embrace of the forest, now stood as a silent witness to the passage of time. The overgrown garden and weathered exterior whispered tales of memories long gone.

As they approached the cottage, Kamery noted the familiar sights of her childhood, the echoes of laughter and the scent of home lingering in the air. The meeting with Shaw was imminent, and the gravity of the situation hung over them like a looming storm.

Inside the cottage, they awaited Shaw's arrival, the air thick with anticipation. The meeting would provide valuable insights into the state of Stormwind, and perhaps set the stage for the challenges that awaited them in the heart of the Alliance's capital.

---

Shaw joins them in cottage, along with Valeera, who has recovered and come from Ironforge. She tells them that King Magni had recently gone to Stormwind to request aid against the Dark Iron dwarves, but had returned disappointed that Varian had denied his request. Knowing that she had been travelling with Varian, and that the Varian she had known would never had denied such a request, Valeera had found an opportunity to speak privately with the dwarven king. He had told her that yes, Varian was back on the throne of Stormwind, although he had been very subservient to his advisor Lady Prestor, and that Anduin had approached Magni as he left the city, to tell the dwarven king that he suspected that something was amiss with his father.

In the cottage in Elwynn Forest, Varian realizes that it is his other half that is now sitting on the throne, being influenced or controlled by Onyxia. The need to confront her becomes even more urgent, tempered by the need to ensure Anduin's safety.

---

The atmosphere in the cottage became charged with tension as Valeera's revelations unfolded. Mathias Shaw, the seasoned spymaster, absorbed the information with a furrowed brow. Varian Wrynn, now aware that his other half was potentially under the influence of Onyxia, felt a surge of conflicting emotions – urgency to confront the threat, tempered by the profound need to ensure his son's safety.

Valeera's words hung in the air, painting a stark picture of Stormwind's current state. The once-commanding figure of Varian Wrynn, a symbol of strength and leadership, now sat on the throne as a puppet. Lady Prestor's subtle influence, a web woven with deception, had ensnared the city.

Varian clenched his fists, the weight of responsibility pressing upon him. &quot;We can't let this deception continue. Onyxia must be exposed, and I need to reclaim my place on the throne – for the sake of Stormwind and my son.&quot;

The group, now united in purpose, began to strategize. The meeting in the cottage became a crucible for their resolve, forging a plan to expose Onyxia's deceit, free Stormwind from her grip, and ensure the safety of Anduin Wrynn. The stage was set for a clandestine mission that would shape the fate of Stormwind.

---

General Marcus Jonathan, initially suspicious, was convinced of the group's loyalty by Windsor, and the gates of Stormwind were opened to them.  As Lady Prestor summoned soldiers to stop the group, the Varian on the throne defied her control, asserting that she lacked the authority.  Marshall Windsor and an exact duplicate of Varian entered the room to the shock of the other Varian, Bolvar, and young Anduin.

The atmosphere in Stormwind's throne room was thick with a tension that could be cut with a blade as Marshall Windsor recited the draconic incantation. Lady Prestor stared imperiously down at the assembled group of adventurers, Windsor, and the unexpected arrival of a second Varian Wrynn.

As the incantation came to an end, the medallion that Bolvar Fordragon wore around his neck shattered, and the regent found his mind suddenly clearing.  The final word, &quot;Onyxia,&quot; lingered in the air for a moment, before Lady Prestor's face twisted in rage, and she transformed into the fearsome black dragon and struck down Windsor with one great claw.

The clash with Onyxia escalated as black dragonkin guards, disguised as Stormwind soldiers, joined the fray. The two Varians found themselves initially at odds, but Anduin, showing wisdom beyond his years, urged them to unite against the greater threat.

Onyxia, sensing the danger, turned her magic on Anduin. In a selfless act to protect the young prince, both Varians leapt in front of the spell. The magic that had split them was undone, merging them back into one true Varian.

Meanwhile, the adventurers, along with Bolvar, fought valiantly against the black dragonkin guards. With renewed determination, the united Varian led the charge against Onyxia. The battle reached its climax as the group combined their strength to defeat the malevolent black dragon.

As the echoes of the conflict settled in the throne room, the city of Stormwind bore witness to the restoration of its true king. Varian Wrynn, now whole and resolute, looked out over his people, the threat of Onyxia eradicated. The adventurers, having played a pivotal role in this momentous event, stood alongside their king, ready for the challenges that awaited Stormwind and Azeroth.

            <Title>Clues lead to Theramore</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bryna is studying in Theramore
- Carolyn, Kamery, and Elthas arrive following Mikhail's lead about Hendel</Synopsis>
            <Text>Two weeks later, unaware of her friends’ adventures, Bryna stood in Jaina Proudmoore’s library. She looked around, her dark eyes drinking in the rows upon rows of arcane tomes. No matter how many times she had come in here over the past month, the expanse of the place always amazed her. Tucked away in the top of an unassuming tower in the middle of Theramore, the expansive library extended into magical space. Soft magical lighting illuminated the room, easy on the eyes yet always giving enough light to read by. Thick woven carpets covered the stone floors; they served the dual purpose of muffling footsteps and keeping the room warm. The books themselves, of course, were the main focus of the room, with their multicolored spines shimmering and glittering with gold and silver lettering.
Continuing to marvel at the amount of knowledge stored here, Bryna walked over to a nearby shelf, perusing the titles. Her dark eyes drank in the titles, even as another part of her mind fidgeted with the familiar restlessness. No matter how enticing a place was, she always seemed to leave too soon, to seek excitement, to look for novelty.
Her drifting thoughts were interrupted by Jaina’s arrival. The powerful arch-mage hadn’t been what Bryna had expected at all. Blonde and slim, she looked more youthful than her nearly forty years. She had a friendly smile, and her charismatic attitude explained a lot about why her people here remained loyal to her above all else, even though Theramore was loosely allied with Stormwind.
“What are you studying today?” Jaina asked as she approached Bryna to join her in looking at the titles on the shelf.
Bryna ducked her head slightly, allowing the wide brim of her red had to hide her eyes from the arch-mage’s perceptive sight. “I’m not sure,” she admitted, hearing the restlessness in her voice.
Jaina didn’t comment on her tone though, only perused the shelves herself, before touching one slender finger to a purple tome highlighted with gold lettering. “What about another polymorph spell?”
At the older mage’s suggestion, Bryna perked up, feeling a flicker of interest. She did love polymorph spells; after teleportation spells, they were perhaps her favorite. She pulled the tome down, feeling its weight in her hands.
As Bryna settled into one of the comfortable armchairs scattered about the room and began perusing the new spell, Jaina began selecting her own reading material, but she was interrupted by a magical shimmer in the middle of the room, signally the arrival of one of her other guests, the arch-mage Tervosh. His robes were similar in style to Jaina’s, but the black and gold coloring contrasted sharply with her purple and white.
Jaina turned to look at the new arrival, and from her seat, Bryna watched curiously.
“My Lady,” the arch-mage sounded tense. “A new development in the ongoing investigation.” He glanced over at Bryna, obviously being vague in her presence. “Several others have arrived investigating the same matter. I have sent them on their way to confront the miscreant, however, they may need assistance if he has associates.”
Jaina nodded, apparently familiar with the situation. Glancing over at Bryna thoughtfully for a moment, she then invited, “Bryna, join us.” Her blue eyes shone with understanding as Bryna eagerly set her book aside on a small wooden side-table and stood.
Tervosh gestured Bryna to his left. “Stand close, I can teleport us to the location.”
Obeying his command, Bryna stood near the stern-faced arch-mage, as Jaina moved close on his other side, and felt the familiar tingle of teleportation begin. It was strange not being in command of the spell herself, but she allowed herself to relax into it. Despite his brusque manner, Tervosh was a more than competent mage, and Jaina trusted him.
The arch-mage skillfully twisted the arcane energies, engulfing all three in the swirling sensations of teleportation. The transfer was swift, and soon her senses cleared and she looked around to orient herself.
Her gaze fell first on a small watchtower just ahead of them, where they had arrived on a dusty road winding through the middle of a swamp. The pungent smell of rotting vegetation assailed her nostrils and she wrinkled her nose in distaste. She recognized the terrain as being just outside of Theramore. This must be one of the watchtowers that guarded the approach to the coastal city.
Above the ever-present buzzing of insects, an angry shout rose from just beyond the watchtower, followed by the dull sound of a metal blade striking wood. An angry growl followed, and then a yelp of pain.
At the sound, Tervosh smiled slightly. “Perhaps they may not need as much aid as I feared. Come.”
He hadn’t needed to add the command; Bryna was already moving, her soft boots stirring up puffs of dust as she jogged along the road past the tower’s ramp. Coming around to the far side of the tower, she spied the fight, and startled recognition almost made her stop.
Despite her surprise, her mind quickly pulled up the relevant spells, including the newly-learned polymorph. Tervosh’s ‘other investigators’ were none other than her companions from Stormwind—Carolyn, Kamery, and she presumed the unfamiliar sandy-brown bear to be Elthas. Runes dyed into the fur on his shoulders matched the ones she knew from his panther form.
Elthas growled menacingly, holding the attention of two of the three men that they faced. The men were all dressed in the armor of Theramore, which surprised Bryna, given the townspeople’s loyalty to Jaina. No time to wonder though, she decided, as the third man swung his sword at Kamery. He wasn’t unskilled, but the rogue dodged the blow easily.
She wouldn’t be able to keep that up indefinitely though, Bryna knew, and her friends needed the rogue’s daggers to dispatch the other two swiftly. Carolyn’s staff landed a solid blow, but the priestess’s forte was healing, not combat. Elthas’s fur was matted with blood in several places, but watching Carolyn’s mouth move in holy incantations, Bryna suspected that the wounds beneath were healed already.
Her own mouth and hands moved then, enacting the new polymorph spell on Kamery’s assailant. With satisfaction, she watched the burly man transform instantly into a turtle and stumble off in confusion. The rogue, to her credit, didn’t break from the melee, instead turning her daggers on the other two.
Under the assault, the two quickly caved, scrambling away to run into undergrowth that surrounded them. Bryna wondered briefly how they would fare against the alligators that inhabited the swamp, but her thoughts quickly returned to her friends.
“What are you doing here?” she asked.
“Let’s deal with the matter at hand first,” Tervosh interrupted. With a word, he broke Bryna’s polymorph spell, wrapping the soldier in arcane bonds. Bryna wondered when she would be able to learn that spell.
Setting aside her curiosity, Bryna listened as the man began babbling rapidly as Jaina approached.
“Please…please…” he begged. “Lady Proudmoore. I didn’t mean to…” He broke off at Jaina’s cold glare.
“You will tell us everything, Private Hendel,” she promised. “Tervosh, bring him back to the keep.”
With a nod, the arch-mage obeyed, and he and Hendel disappeared in an arcane shimmer.
Jaina looked between Bryna and her friends with a smile. “These are the friends you told me about, aren’t they?” As Bryna nodded, the arch-mage seemed to reach a decision. “Tell her everything,” she directed the others. “Then meet me back in the tower. We will see what we can learn from Hendel.”
With a word of power, Jaina also disappeared, leaving Bryna alone on the path facing her friends. The fight over, Elthas had shifted back into his familiar panther form.
“It’s a long story,” Carolyn began.
Kamery gestured to the road, indicating that they should start walking back to town as they talked, and Bryna fell into step easily. Between the soldiers who had fled but could return at any time, the ever-present wildlife, and the rumored Ogres further north, she would be happy to return to the safety of the walls of Theramore.
As they walked, Bryna listened intently as Carolyn and Kamery wove their tale of an investigation into a missing diplomat. The sisters’ voices wove together seamlessly as they alternated parts of the story—Carolyn’s soft tones contrasting with and complementing Kamery’s more clipped delivery. They took turns easily, often completing each other’s sentences.
They had already told most of the tale to Elthas, Bryna realized, as they spoke of how the druid had come to Carolyn’s rescue in Menethil Harbor, but even that practice didn’t completely explain the synergy between the sisters. She was as captivated by their connection as she was by their story.
Bryna’s captivation with the interweaving voices was abruptly shattered however, when they relayed what they had learned from Slim in Menethil Harbor.
“The King?!” she interrupted, eyes widening.
The other three nodded, their expressions telling her that they had shared her shock when they had learned the dire news. Her eyes narrowed as she supposed that this was why Tervosh and Jaina had been so evasive earlier.
Bryna’s mind whirled with the shock, adjusting to the new information, as the walls of Theramore came into sight ahead. White walls, similar to Stormwind’s own, surrounded the island that the city was built on. A wide stone bridge crossed the narrow straight separating it from the swampy mainland.
As they crossed the bridge, Elthas, having regained some of his natural playfulness, leaped lightly onto the low wall edging the bridge, navigating the narrow beam easily. The sisters quickly filled in the remaining details, of their voyage to Theramore seeking Hendel, and Tervosh’s directions to the watchtower.
Bryna’s mind drifted as the story reached the part that she had arrived for. These plots and investigations aren’t that recent, so who did Raynn deliver Trias’s report to? Trias can’t have known, not without saying anything to us, or the sisters later. At least Hendel seemed intimidated by Jaina. Hopefully she can get something from him—if he knows anything.</Text>

            <Text>— Prologue —
Prologue - Wanted: Hogger: Introduces Raynn (a warrior) and Kamery (a rogue) meeting in a fight against Hogger. Raynn is straightforward, but hiding things in her past. Kamery’s master at SI:7, Mathias Shaw, is curious about Raynn and has encouraged Kamery to learn more about her.
— Section 1 - The Defias Threat —
Chapter 1 - Westfall: Kamery investigates the Defias in Westfall, and realizes that she needed help.
Chapter 2 - Kalimdor: Introduces Carolyn (Kamery's twin sister), Elthas (Carolyn's druid friend), and Bryna (a mage they hire for a portal who Elthas invites to join them). Carolyn is kind and peaceful. Elthas is energetic and inquisitive; he prefers to stay in feline form. Bryna is pragmatic and mercenary.
Chapter 3 - Some Assembly Required: Raynn has some internal reflections on her past, hinting at connections with Thrall and Grom Hellscream on her way to join Kamery in Westfall. Carolyn, Elthas, and Bryna are already there, and they plan their infiltration of the Defias underground stronghold. Bryna and Carolyn bond over repairing Carolyn’s robe. Kamery and Carolyn have a quiet moment of reunion.
Chapter 4 - The Deadmines: Elthas exuberantly explores the fields of Westfall as the group makes their way to the Deadmines. Once inside, he and Kamery use stealth to scout; when they are attacked, he uses bear form, and then heals her, impressing her. Kamery picks the lock of the entrance door and they enter. Raynn is taken aback when Carolyn, the healer, joins the melee with her staff. The group faces their first major threat and fights well as a group.
Chapter 5 - VanCleef: The group discovers the center of the Defias plot - a massive dreadnought loaded with explosives, hidden in a cavern that opens to the sea not far from Stormwind. They defeat the leader of the Defias, Edwin VanCleef, and destroy the dreadnought.
— Section 2 - The Lescovar Incident —

            <Synopsis>- Bryna joins for the trip to Gadgetzan
- Jaina provides gryphons
- Raynn reports to Trenton Lighthammer in Tanaris</Synopsis>
            <Text>Looking down at the wide white expanse of the Shimmering Flats below them, Raynn was thankful that Jaina had provided a pair of gryphons. She had studied the map in Booty Bay carefully, anticipating having to make the journey on horseback—west from Dustwallow, through the Barrens, down to Thousand Needles, then through the area they were flying over right now.
They, because Bryna had unexpectedly decided to join her. Raynn glanced over at the mage, whose red hat brim was fluttering in the wind of their passage, but still, somehow, staying firmly attached to the mage’s head. I’m not the only one with magical headgear. Raynn smiled, still feeling the extra power of Jaina’s additional work on her circlet.
She had watched quietly as the two mages had chattered happily over the circlet, not understanding most of the technical magical talk, but enjoying seeing her two friends, one old and one new, sharing their passion. Afterwards, Bryna had looked thoughtfully at the circlet, as Jaina handed it back to Raynn.
“I understand the basics, but I’ll need to practice.” The mage had frowned, then declared, “Gadgetzan.”
Raynn had been startled enough to blurt out, “I’m going there.”
A flurry of explanations later, and Bryna had joined her. Apparently there was a trading house in Gadgetzan, and Bryna thought she could buy some cheap materials to practice the new enchantments on. Bryna had also been enthusiastic about her new mithril plate and excited to see the set completed. Raynn hadn’t considered the enchantments she wove into her blacksmithing anywhere close to the same as the work the mages did, but Bryna had brushed that aside, saying “magic is magic.”
A dark line of hills in the distance marked the border between the salt flats and the desert of Tanaris. Gadgetzan was just over those hills, and in the town, Trenton Lighthammer, Smith of the Mithril Order.</Text>

            <Text>Carolyn tried to stay calm under the piercing stare of the King. It had been a shock, when she had recognized him. Regardless of who he was, she wouldn’t let anyone speak to Raynn that way. Her intervention had also possibly averted another battle; seeing Raynn’s confusion, she wasn’t sure that the warrior recognized King Varian.
He was an imposing figure; she had only glimpsed him at a distance a handful of times in her youth. The scars cutting across his face made him all the more intimidating, but, she reminded herself, she had faced plenty of intimidation before.
Her thoughts went back to Tyrande Whisperwind and Jaina Proudmoore, both powerful and authoritative, and yet still approachable and ordinary people underneath. Varian, beneath the scars, the barbaric armor, and the heavy muscles, was still a man also.
Fortified, she addressed his apparent confusion at her defense of Raynn. “I trained at Northshire.”
He blinked, breaking that penetrating gaze, then broke into laugh. Just Human indeed. Carolyn smiled back as he nodded at her. “That explains a lot,” the King acknowledged.
His assessment turned to the other two then. “And you two?” His eyes ran over Raynn’s armor and Kamery’s black leather and bandanna. “SI:7?” he guessed of the rogue, gesturing for them to start back to Morgan’s Vigil.</Text>

            <Title>34-12-01-L120-Visions of N'Zoth</Title>
            <Text>In the grand halls of Stormwind Keep, Raynn made her way to Anduin's chambers, a sense of anticipation lingering in the air. The familiar tapestries and polished stone were a testament to the strength of the Alliance, but today, an unusual tension seemed to underscore the atmosphere.

As she approached, Raynn noticed a figure standing beside Anduin, a dark silhouette contrasting sharply with the golden glow of the room. It was Wrathion, the Black Prince, an enigmatic presence with motives often shrouded in mystery.

Anduin turned to greet her, his normally warm eyes now reflecting an eerie luminosity. &quot;Raynn, I'm glad you've come. There's something we need to discuss, something of great importance.&quot;

Raynn eyed Anduin with concern, sensing a subtle shift in his demeanor. &quot;What's going on, Anduin? You seem... different.&quot;

Wrathion stepped forward, his dragonkin eyes fixated on Raynn. &quot;The whispers of N'Zoth are growing louder, and we must be vigilant. Anduin has taken necessary precautions.&quot;

Anduin nodded, his expression a blend of determination and weariness. &quot;Raynn, I need you to understand. N'Zoth's influence is insidious, and I won't let it corrupt the heart of the Alliance. I've taken steps to safeguard our future.&quot;

Raynn's brows furrowed in confusion. &quot;Steps? What kind of steps?&quot;

Anduin extended his hand, revealing a shimmering orb that seemed to pulse with dark energy. &quot;This is the Vision of N'Zoth. It allows us to see into the shadowy depths of the Old God's influence. We can't afford to be blind to the threats that lurk within.&quot;

Raynn hesitated, her gaze shifting between Anduin and the ominous orb. &quot;And what would you have me do, Anduin?&quot;

The young king's eyes held a mixture of urgency and trust. &quot;Join us, Raynn. Help us unveil the true extent of N'Zoth's reach. The Alliance needs individuals of strength and resilience now more than ever.&quot;

As she accepted the responsibility placed upon her, Raynn couldn't shake the feeling that the shadows of N'Zoth were poised to weave a dark tapestry, and the fate of Azeroth hung in the balance.</Text>

            <Title>Thrall</Title>
            <Text>Four more charges, and they were done. Triggering the charges, Raynn watched in grim satisfaction as the crude huts exploded. The Orcs here would join Thrall in his search for the free clans, and would eventually return to help him liberate the rest of his people.
For now though, it was Thrall himself who needed liberating. He hadn’t spoken much of his escape, she realized, as she led the way up to the main keep. Many of the guards had been drawn out to fight the fires below, and those who remained were no match for her determination as she cleared a path to the basement.
The dank cell made her heart break, and a quick glance at her companions showed that they were likewise affected. She was relieved that they had abandoned their earlier doubts.
Thrall’s familiar, deep voice broke into her thoughts. “Who are you?” He didn’t recognize her, Raynn realized with a pang of sadness. But of course, they wouldn’t actually meet for another year. “Just leave me be.” He sounded hopeless, not yet the Thrall she had known.
“We are friends of Taretha. We are here to get you out of here.” Kamery spoke, weaving the story as easily as her nimble fingers opened the crude lock. As Raynn’s throat tightened with emotion, she was once again grateful for the rogue’s presence.
“You are friends of Taretha? Very well then. Let’s go.”</Text>

            <Title>Three Corners</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Camping for the night on the way to Elwynn Forest</Synopsis>
            <Text>Although the Harvest Festival date gave them a deadline, they still had two days to make the journey. They did not press hard, planning to stop near Three Corners for the night.  Shaw’s instructions had made them wary, so they cut through the hills north and west of Lakeshire, avoiding the small town. They did not want to alert their enemies in Stormwind prematurely.
Elthas loped easily through the rolling landscape, hoping that he would finally have some time to complete his leather-working project. He had finished sealing the leather in Lakeshire—he now only needed to thread the lacings.
Varian and Kamery led the way, as the only ones truly familiar with this territory, guiding them past the eastern end of the long lake. Finally, at mid-afternoon, they halted in a sparse grove of trees on the hillside overlooking Three Corners, where the roads from Redridge, Elwynn Forest, and Duskwood met. This close to the watchtower that guarded the intersection, they didn’t light a campfire. The air was warm, and the night promised to be pleasant enough in just bedrolls.
To Elthas’s satisfaction, Kamery slipped away from the camp to gather nearby herbs. Bryna followed the rogue, mumbling something about dinner. Settling on a fallen log, Elthas pulled out the nearly-completed bracers. He took a moment of satisfaction, his eyes tracing the intricately tooled designs. Not only decorative, each line and curve held an enchantment, carefully crafted to enhance the wearer’s agility.
The moment was interrupted as Carolyn sat next to him. “They’re almost done, aren’t they?” The priestess smiled; she had known what he was working on. A laugh entered her voice as she told him, “Kamery asked if I could make leather armor the other day.” Gesturing to the two black-dyed bracers, her voice became heartfelt. “She’ll love them.”
Elthas smiled. “I hope so.” He grinned, adding, “If not, we know they’d fit you.”
With a laugh, Carolyn left him to his work, crossing the campsite to speak with Raynn. The warrior was polishing one of her own bracers, frowning at a dent in the metal. She would need a hammer and anvil to properly repair it. On the other side of the small camp, Broll, Varian, and Windsor had been speaking in low tones. As their conversation ended, the older druid crossed to Elthas.
“May I join you?” Broll’s respectful tone surprised Elthas. Although enigmatic, the other druid was an elder, many centuries older than Elthas himself. He nodded, and Broll settled into the spot recently vacated by Carolyn. They had fought side by side, as equals, in Blackrock Mountain, Elthas realized, with a small surge of self-confidence.
That confidence was boosted even more when Broll, after a questioning look, picked up one of the unfinished brown bracers to examine it. “Excellent work.” The older druid smiled, as Elthas thanked him. Broll’s own armor was even more heavily enchanted—work that Elthas hoped to be able to learn someday, but these bracers came close. “A pair for yourself, and one for Kamery?” Broll guessed.
Elthas nodded, pulling the lace on the second black bracer tight. Just in time, as Kamery glided silently back into the clearing. Spotting her sister, Carolyn gave Elthas a glance. At his nod, she drew the rogue over to where he stood to greet her.
Kamery looked between the two curiously, then her eyes widened as Elthas presented her with the set of black bracers. They shone with appreciation as she accepted the gift, and felt the magical enhancements they contained. “El, they’re wonderful!” Spontaneously, the rogue threw her arms around him. “Thank you.”
Elthas returned the embrace briefly, but then released her. “Try them on!” he urged, wanting to make sure he had fit them properly. Carolyn had helped, and he remembered the priestess’s laugh at the awkwardness of the heavy leather on her wrist. He hoped that the sisters’ similarities also included wrist size.
Kamery quickly removed her old bracers, and slipped on the new ones. To Elthas’s relief they fit perfectly. As the rogue showed the new armor to Raynn and Varian, who had also approached in curiosity, Bryna returned to the camp.
The mage was accompanied by the delicious aroma of roasted rabbit. Varian turned to her with a frown. “A cooking fire? Or did you enter Lakeshire?”
Bryna shook her head. “Of course not.” She chuckled. “I may be a frost mage, but I do know some fire spells. Not very good for skinning”—she grinned at Elthas and Carolyn—“but effective for cooking dinner.”
Fortified by a warm meal after all, they settled down for the night. In the fading evening light, Elthas finished lacing his own bracers. Slipping them over his wrists, he shifted to feline form, feeling the tingle of their magic in his paws. Curling up between Carolyn and Kamery, he drifted off to sleep, dreaming of chasing rabbits through Elwynn Forest.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Broll teaches Elthas to Dreamwalk
- Broll and Elthas go to Moonglade
- Druids/Green Dragonflight can't help, but suggest the Blue Dragonflight in Winterspring
- return to Stormwind</Synopsis>
            <Text>At Broll’s invitation, Elthas felt his eyes widen. He knew of the Moonglade, the sacred druidic haven in northern Kalimdor, but he had yet to learn the spell to journey there.
“I haven’t learned to Dreamwalk yet,” he admitted.
However, Broll just smiled. “Then it’s time you learned. We will need a place of nature though.” He looked over at Varian questioningly, as Elthas’s spirits leaped at the casual acceptance of his readiness.
Remembering an earlier visit to the Keep, Elthas thought of the courtyard nearby. “Would an open courtyard suffice?” he asked. “There is a grassy area, with some small trees and shrubs.”
Broll’s attention returned to him, approving. “That should do well.” He looked back at Varian. “With your leave?”
With a firm nod, the Human King gave his approval. “Bring us good news,” he entreated, as Shaw handed the medallion to Broll.
The older druid frowned as he felt the item in his hand. “This does not belong in the Glade.” He handed the medallion back to Shaw. “I will be able to communicate our needs well enough through the Dream.”
Turning to Elthas, Broll gestured with one hand for Elthas to lead the way to the courtyard. Before turning to leave, Elthas glanced at Carolyn, and saw his own eagerness reflected in her face.
It was only a short walk from the throne room to the courtyard, and the two druids passed through the marble hallways in silence. Elthas wanted to shift to feline form, but felt that it would be disrespectful as Broll hadn’t shifted, so he remained on two feet. His mind roiled with everything that had happened in such a short time.
Kamery had told them tersely what Windsor had done, as they had entered the fray against the dragonspawn, after Anduin’s impulsive dash across the throne room. Now, Elthas took a moment of silent gratitude for the Marshal’s sacrifice. The massive black dragon that Windsor had unmasked had been intimidating, but the immediate threat of her minions converging on Bryna and Carolyn had taken priority with the druids and Kamery.
He had seen the strain on his Human priestess friend’s face, even before she had intervened against Onyxia directly and been struck down. There had been no time to speak afterwards, but he had been glad to see her rise quickly with Kamery’s aid.
His thoughts came full circle, remembering her excitement for him to learn a new druidic ability, as they entered the small courtyard. Broll deemed it more than sufficient, and began to show Elthas how to draw on the threads of nature to commune with the Emerald Dream.</Text>

            <Title>25-03-18-L17-Respite for a Prince</Title>
            <Text>The cobblestone streets of Stormwind bustled with activity as Anduin, hidden beneath a concealing cloak, followed Mathias Shaw through the city. Shaw, ever watchful, kept a discreet pace beside the young prince. The air was crisp with the scent of the sea, and the distant sounds of merchants haggling and craftsmen at work filled the air.

As they walked through the Dwarven District, Shaw spoke in hushed tones, &quot;Your Highness, this cloak should help you blend in. We don't want to attract unnecessary attention.&quot;

Anduin nodded, adjusting the cloak as he observed the skilled artisans and bustling market stalls. The pair made their way toward the blacksmithing trainer's workshop, where Raynn was honing her craft.

Peering through the busy crowd, they spotted Raynn amidst the clinking sounds of hammers on anvils. The rhythmic melody of metalworking echoed in the district. Raynn, focused and determined, forged a new piece of armor, her skill evident in each precise movement.

Anduin watched her work, captivated by the grace with which she manipulated molten metal. Shaw, ever vigilant, kept an eye on their surroundings as they lingered near the workshop.

&quot;You've chosen an unusual companion, Your Highness,&quot; Shaw remarked quietly. &quot;What draws you to this blacksmith?&quot;

Anduin considered the question before answering, &quot;She saved lives today, mine included. Lady Prestor may not see her worth, but I do.&quot;

Shaw nodded, understanding the prince's sentiment. As Raynn completed her work, she noticed the presence of the cloaked figure and Mathias Shaw nearby. Setting her tools aside, she approached.

&quot;Can I help you, strangers?&quot; Raynn inquired, her gaze flickering between Shaw and the cloaked figure.

Anduin revealed his identity, pulling back the cloak to expose his face. &quot;I'm Anduin Wrynn, and this is Mathias Shaw. Lady Prestor may not have fully appreciated your service, but I wanted to express my gratitude.&quot;

Raynn's eyes widened in surprise, and she instinctively bowed her head. &quot;Your Highness, I did not expect...&quot;

Anduin interrupted with a smile, &quot;No need for formalities. You've earned them, and this is a token of my appreciation.&quot; He extended the signet ring, a symbol of Stormwind's royal lineage.

Raynn hesitated before accepting it, her expression a mix of gratitude and humility. &quot;Thank you, Prince Anduin. I am honored.&quot;

Shaw, ever vigilant, glanced around, reminding them of the need for caution. &quot;We should be on our way, Your Highness.&quot;

Anduin nodded, taking a last glance at the skilled blacksmith. &quot;Thank you, Raynn. I hope our paths cross again.&quot;

As they made their way back through the Dwarven District, Anduin pondered the events that had unfolded, realizing that Stormwind held more than just the grand halls of the Keep – it held stories of courage and craftsmanship woven into its very streets.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Two Varians initially at odds
</Synopsis>
            <Text>At the base of the dais in the throne room, Bryna’s mind worked to process the chaos that had erupted in the last few minutes. The clash of weapons and clatter of dragonspawn claws on marble floors echoed through the room. Gathering a frost-bolt, she flung it to slow the approach of a nearby dragonspawn. Beside her, Jaina Proudmoore was also employing the slowing, chilling magic.
Bryna wondered if Jaina had know what Windsor’s spell would do to him. The flame had caught her by surprise, although in hindsight, it seemed to fit with what she knew of such incantations. Something as powerful as unveiling a draconic brood-mother would require a great sacrifice.
The room was swarming with the black dragon’s lesser kin, as more entered from the side hallways. They carried with them a harsh, smoky scent, reminiscent of volcanic ash. The nobles who hadn’t been dragonspawn in disguise had fled immediately, leaving only herself, Jaina, Carolyn, Raynn, and several badly outmatched guardsmen to face the dragon and her kin.
Had Windsor himself known what the spell would entail? He had seemed confident that his research had been complete, so it seemed likely. Although she had only known him for a few days, Bryna had come to respect the man’s dedication to his task. He had been remarkably thorough, with not much more than suspicion to go on.
She amended her mental list of allies, as Shaw emerged from the shadows beside Bolvar Fordragon. The paladin seemed frozen in indecision as he watched the two Varians argue, but with a few words from the spy-master, he rallied himself, taking a more protective stance to Carolyn’s right. Shaw himself darted through the shadows to bury his daggers in a nearby dragonspawn’s flank.
Carolyn had known, she realized. There could be no other explanation for the priestess’s calm acceptance. Despite her adventures in Kalimdor, Carolyn was no expert on draconic magic, so Windsor must have told her. Thoughtfully, Bryna flung another frost-bolt, her admiration for the late Marshal growing ever stronger.
As she fired off another frost-bolt at an encroaching dragonspawn, she could hear the two Varians angrily demanding answers of each other behind her. A glance over her shoulder confirmed that they were facing off against one another to one side of the looming dragon. Their swords were drawn on each other, rather than uniting against the obvious common enemy.
Turning back to her own draconic enemies, Bryna gathered another frost-bolt. Lo’Gosh—she decided to use Broll’s gladiator name for the man they had met in the Burning Steppes—snarled at the other Varian. “Your blind obedience to this snake has cost us much.”
Her instinct was to freeze her enemies in place and retreat, but there was no room to retreat further onto the dais, and she wouldn’t leave Carolyn unprotected. The priestess’s whispered spell-casting was non-stop as she healed Raynn and Bolvar. The warrior was holding the attention of several dragonspawn and Onyxia herself, while the paladin had drawn the attention of most of the closer dragonspawn on his side of the room.
“Her hold on me weakens every day,” Varian retorted with regal aplomb; he seemed to have regained some of his will after all. Bryna fired off another frost-bolt, wishing that she could channel some of her irritation at the two Kings into her magic. Jaina hit the same target with an arcane barrage, and thankfully, the dragonspawn fell.
“You have endangered our kingdom and the Alliance.” Lo’Gosh wasn’t appeased. “You have endangered our son!”</Text>

            <Synopsis>- group disrupts the dark iron mines in searing gorge
- Sent on to help maxwell in burning steppes</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kamery smiled in weary satisfaction as she mounted the steep path to Marshal’s Refuge. From the cave at the back of the small plateau, she could hear the low voices of Williden and Hol’anyee, probably discussing their latest research on the crystals found throughout the crater. To her left, the main camp of the expedition rose over several moss-covered tiers. She and her friends had settled into a quiet corner near the top. 
As she did most days, Kamery had spent the afternoon roaming the lush crater floor looking for herbs, and now her bags were bulging with pungent silversage and glistening dreamfoil. She had also found a few delicate blue flowers of blindweed, which she thought was perhaps misnamed, as it was actually quite useful.
Bryna, she was certain, would want her to sell the valuable blooms, but she suspected that the mage would change her tune when Kamery showed her the magic-enhancement potion that she could make with it.
Already anticipating the conversation, Kamery absently stopped at the small mailbox near the cave entrance, to check for messages. Although nothing had arrived yet over the nearly two months that they had been here, she still checked every day. She might have wondered if Shaw didn’t know where to find them, but she knew the man too well. Also, she was fairly certain that the Goblin digger, Spark Nilminer, was on Shaw’s payroll.
Whatever the means, Shaw did indeed know where to reach them—Kamery pulled a thin, sealed letter out of the mailbox. Her name was written on the front in Shaw’s bold, blocky handwriting. Did he consider them ready, or was he simply out of time, she wondered. Turning over the question in her own mind as she walked slowly up to their campsite, enjoying the cooling effect of even the small change in elevation, she realized that they were indeed ready.
Raynn and Bryna were already kneeling beside the low fire, sorting through the variety of ores and gems from Raynn’s day’s work. The mage was efficiently placing items in several bags, which Kamery knew were designated for sale, use, or discard. The warrior had removed several parts of her full plate armor, and was now clad in only her breastplate, leg-plates and boots. Occasionally Raynn would move an item from the for-sale bag to the for-use one, and Bryna would frown at the warrior.
Kamery chuckled, as she sat down cross-legged, breathing deeply of the aromatic stew that was simmering over the fire. Elthas and Carolyn must have been by earlier in the afternoon—they did most of the group’s cooking. She hoped they would be back soon, so they could all hear Shaw’s message together.
Bryna noticed the letter in her hand. “Is that from Shaw?” the mage asked, her eyes brightening under the wide brim of her red hat. She looked ridiculous out here in the green jungle, but Kamery had long since realized that this was part of the mage’s carefully cultivated camouflage.
Wondering idly what diemetradons thought of red hats, Kamery nodded. As she unfastened the buckles to loosen her leather tunic, she reflected that at least the rest of Bryna’s outfit was suited to the warm, humid atmosphere, with her lightweight vest and short pants.
“El and Caro should be back soon,” Raynn answered before she could ask. The warrior reached out to stir the stew, and Kamery noticed Bryna take advantage of the distraction to move a particularly sparkling gem back to the for-sale bag. Her lips twitched under her bandanna.
Raynn noticed immediately, frowning at the mage as she emphatically moved the gem back to the for-use bag.
Bryna sighed. “You’re hopeless. The world is full of rare and valuable treasures, many of which are for sale to the highest bidder, and you are missing out on it all.”
“It’s valuable,” Raynn argued, her long auburn ponytail swaying as she shook her head.
“That’s the point!” the mercenary mage retorted, but she shifted her weight to one hip, settling back comfortably. The more relaxed pose indicated that she had shifted away from the trader mindset for the moment.
“Is Bry trying to sell off our bedrolls again?” a smooth male voice broke in, as Elthas and Carolyn climbed the hill to join them. Elthas, Kamery had noticed, was spending more and more time in his Kaldorei form, which he found easier to speak in. Another sign of how close we’ve become.
Elthas tossed a large leather bag towards his bedroll; Kamery knew it would be full of the hides that he and Carolyn had harvested that day. She was still adjusting to the idea that her sister knew how to properly dress and skin wild animals. The crater had certainly given the two plenty of resources; even now, the ever-present chirps, howls, and roars echoed from below, although Kamery had learned to tune the sounds out most of the time.
“More devilsaurs?” Bryna asked, eying the bag with interest. “Although, I’m not sure if they’re worth more raw these days, or if you should craft them into armor first.” She seemed to have given up on Raynn’s gemstone.
“You never stop, do you?” Raynn snorted, as she gathered up her bags of ore and put them away.
Bryna smirked, then changed the subject with one of her mercurial shifts. “Kam got a letter from Shaw,” she told Carolyn and Elthas as they settled down by the fire.
Picking up a nearby stick, Elthas leaned forward to poke at the fire, sending a shower of sparks into the air with a popping crackle. The light from the flames danced over his bare arms, highlighting the dark druidic tattoos that curved from his gloves up to both shoulders.
All eyes were on her now, Kamery realized. She turned the thin letter over in her hand to break the red wax of the seal, feeling the well-known surge of anticipation that raced through her at the thought of a new assignment. As usual, the missive was only a single sheet, with a terse message penned on it.
She read aloud, “‘Return to the Eastern Kingdoms. Avoid Stormwind.’” Kamery paused to absorb that unusual instruction, then continued, “‘Report to Morgan’s Vigil in the Burning Steppes.’” The letter was unsigned, as usual.
“That’s it?” Raynn asked.
Kamery laughed. “For Shaw, that’s a lot.” At the warrior’s look of surprise, she added, “He never puts much on paper at least, not where it could be intercepted.”
Raynn nodded her understanding of the terseness, but the cryptic instructions had them puzzled.
“Avoid Stormwind?” Carolyn mused, tucking her white-and-purple robes around her more securely. “I wonder what’s going on.”
Bryna’s dark eyes were thoughtful, reflecting the firelight as she processed the terse instructions. As usual, she was the first to reach a conclusion.
“I can portal us to Ironforge,” Bryna started to stand, but was interrupted by Elthas.
“Stew first,” the druid stated firmly. An amused smile danced on Kamery’s lips; the mage was very decisive with her portal-casting.
After one last dinner in the bare campsite that had become home for so many weeks, they broke camp, packing their belongings and extinguishing the fire. They worked in quiet harmony, each wrapped in their own thoughts of how their now-cohesive group would face this mysterious new assignment and whatever threats lay ahead of them.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Elthas's finds include a set of enchanted manacles, and they realize that the Defias have been looking for a prisoner</Synopsis>
            <Text>The priestess rested her hand on his back, feeling the soft, sleek fur beneath her fingers. It was so different from his panther form, she reflected, marveling once again in the druid’s abilities. When she had been a small child, she had seen a visiting Kaldorei on his moonsaber mount, and had decided that she wanted one herself.
When the sisters’ parents had died, and Kamery had been accepted as a full agent of SI:7, Carolyn had seen her chance to travel to the Kaldorei homeland. There, she had found a frosty reception from the saber trainers, who had insisted that she would need to prove herself to the Kaldorei first. She had eagerly set out to do so, and had immediately realized just how little she actually knew about their society. Druids had been an absolute delight, and traveling with Elthas had taught her so much.
Wondering if the druid’s efforts had brought them anything of use, she watched Kamery and Renn efficiently sorting through the contents of the satchel. The diver was muttering to himself as he discarded items.
“Old coins… ugly jewelry… letters home… hey, what’s this?” At the note of hope, Carolyn, Bryna, and Elthas all moved a little closer, as he held up a pair of golden manacles.
Bryna gave a low whistle. “Those are enchanted.”
Renn nodded thoughtfully. “Their cargo, it wasn’t a thing… it was a person!”
Questioning looks turned on Elthas, and the druid shifted out of his sea lion form to answer more easily. He shook his head as he spoke, his long dark blue hair swishing through the water. “I didn’t see anyone else down there. Not even the Defias divers went that low.”
Renn cocked his head. “Did you cover the whole area? Maybe you missed something?”
Elthas’s stern features formed an uncharacteristic frown as he looked at the diver’s helmet, with it’s small viewing port. “My vision is excellent, and the visibility was good. The sea floor was smooth and clear.”
As if realizing for the first time that the druid hadn’t been encumbered by the restrictive diving gear, Renn nodded apologetically. “You must bring word of this to Lady Jaina without delay. If the Defias were transporting a prisoner, there’s no telling who it might be or if the person is still alive!”
Carolyn felt a shiver run through her that had nothing to do with the cool water. Renn didn’t know everything they did… King Varian Wrynn had to still be alive!
Bryna seemed to agree with the urgency in Renn’s voice, as she had started casting a portal spell even before he spoke. Now, the shimmering opening floated halfway below the water’s surface, the white tower of Theramore visible in its center.
“Don’t worry, I remembered the liquid filter,” she assured them. At their blank looks, the mage shook her head, setting the brim of her red hat rippling. “Never mind, just go.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Bryna leads them past the angry blue dragons
- Haleh tells them to get Drakkisath's blood</Synopsis>
            <Text>The road turned to the south not long after the group split, and shortly a narrow trail split off to the right, leading down into a snowy hollow. Bryna confidently led them down that path.
The bottom of the dell was swarming with blue dragonspawn, coming and going from the entrance to a foreboding cave. Raynn gripped her sword and shield more tightly, wishing that Carolyn, or even Elthas, was still with them.
Bryna, however, was undaunted. She led them around the rim of the basin, into the sparse pine forest beyond. The sharp scent of the trees cut through the crisp, cold air, and Raynn filled her lungs with the refreshing combination.
As the ground began to rise, one particular tree seemed to be a landmark, and Bryna turned to lead them along the edge of the slope. The footing was treacherous on the snow-covered incline, and they walked slowly, carefully.
Coming around a curve of the mountain, they saw a blonde Quel’dorei in blue robes ahead of them. Her perch overlooked ancient ruins on the shore of the frozen lake below, and she seemed to be studying the movements of the spirits.
The Quel’dorei looked up as they approached, giving them a distracted smile. “You’re a long way from home.” As Raynn neared, she recoiled, her fine brows drawing together. “I sense an aura of evil radiating from you. What could you hold that entails such an aura?”
Raynn held out the broken medallion. “Haleh? We’re hoping you could help us repair this.”
“I am Haleh, yes,” she murmured distractedly, her gaze fixed on the medallion. “I should have known—a piece of the Black Dragonflight brood-mother, Onyxia. How revolting…” Haleh trailed off, her mouth twisted in distaste.
Raynn cleared her throat.
“The Aspects insist that we stay out of the affairs of mortals.” Haleh’s eyes looked off into the distance. “In this world, however, such a thing is not always possible - especially when one of our own contemptuously disregards such edicts.”
Her decision made, she turned back to the medallion. “It is a dragon scale, enchanted and transformed.” Her eyes studied the twisted gold and smooth onyx. “Whole, it could have granted access to the beast's lair. Shattered”—one delicate finger reached out to trace the crack, not quite touching the stone—“it is useless.”
Raynn’s heart sank. This had been their only hope; without it, Onyxia could continue to scheme from her lair, rebuilding the Black Dragonflight, to threaten Theramore and beyond. Memories of the unrest and chaos wrought by the Defias ran through her mind. How many more lives would be ruined if the brood-mother’s influence was left unchecked.
She could see her reaction reflected in Kamery’s solemn grey eyes; Bryna’s eyes were hidden below the brim of her hat, but Raynn was certain that the mage was also considering the ramifications, probably in much further detail than she herself could.
Before they could express their dismay though, Haleh shook her head halting their thoughts. “It is possible to repair the item”—she offered them hope, and a challenge—“but to do so would require the blood of a black dragon champion.” Her eyes grew distant again. “There is one—General Drakkisath, ruler of the dragonspawn armies of Blackrock Spire.” She looked at them as she promised, “Return with his blood, and I shall enchant the fragment into something that will grant you access to Onyxia's lair.”</Text>

            <Title>34-12-31-L120-Anduin, Raynn - after Nyalotha</Title>
            <Text>Raynn stood on the shores of Stormwind Harbor, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon where the waters met the sky. The echoes of the Battle for Azeroth lingered in the air, but a sense of relief settled over the city after the defeat of N'Zoth. The scars of war were still visible, but there was a shared understanding among the people that they had a chance for rebuilding.
Anduin approached her quietly, his footsteps blending with the gentle lapping of the waves. He had changed, not just as a leader but as a person. The weight of the crown rested on his brow, and yet, there was a newfound lightness in his eyes.
&quot;Raynn,&quot; he called, his voice carrying a mix of exhaustion and hope.
She turned to face him, the sea breeze tousling her hair. &quot;Anduin,&quot; she greeted, offering a faint smile. The bond they had forged through battles and hardships had evolved into a deep camaraderie.
He joined her by the railing, both of them leaning against it, their gazes fixed on the endless sea. &quot;It's over,&quot; Anduin sighed, his shoulders relaxing.
Raynn nodded, her eyes reflecting the same mixture of weariness and relief. &quot;For now. We'll face whatever comes next together.&quot;
Anduin's gaze shifted from the horizon to her, a contemplative look in his eyes. &quot;You've been a constant, Raynn. Through all of this.&quot;
She met his gaze, a silent acknowledgment passing between them. &quot;We all needed constants in these times.&quot;
He smiled, a genuine expression that reached his eyes. &quot;True. But I've come to rely on yours more than I realized.&quot;
Raynn tilted her head, curious yet understanding. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
Anduin took a moment before speaking, as if choosing his words carefully. &quot;In the midst of chaos, you've been my anchor. Your strength, your loyalty—it's been a guiding force. I don't think I could have faced all of this without you.&quot;
Her expression softened, a warmth spreading through her chest. &quot;Anduin, we faced it together. You've been a leader worth following.&quot;
He took a step closer, the proximity between them diminishing. &quot;I'm grateful for that. More grateful than I can express.&quot;
Raynn felt a subtle shift in the air, a shift that went beyond the weight of their shared experiences. There was a vulnerability in Anduin's eyes, a vulnerability that mirrored her own.
&quot;Anduin,&quot; she began, her voice low and measured, &quot;we've been through so much together. It's forged a bond that I cherish.&quot;
He nodded, a silent agreement passing between them.
She continued, &quot;But there's something more, isn't there? Something that's changed.&quot;
Anduin met her gaze, his expression open and honest. &quot;Yes. Something has changed. In me, in us.&quot;
A quiet understanding settled between them, unspoken words hanging in the air. Anduin reached out, his fingers gently brushing against hers.
Raynn looked down at their intertwined hands, a realization dawning. The transition from friendship to something more had been subtle but profound. The scars of war had brought them together, and in the aftermath, a new connection had blossomed.
&quot;I'm not sure what this is,&quot; Anduin admitted, his gaze searching hers for reassurance.
She smiled, a soft and genuine expression. &quot;Neither am I. But I do know that I'm willing to find out.&quot;
They stood on the shores of Stormwind Harbor, hands entwined, facing an uncertain future. But in that moment, uncertainty felt like the beginning of something beautiful—a journey that would unfold one step at a time.
As the days passed, Stormwind witnessed a subtle shift in the dynamics between Raynn and Anduin. The city, slowly recovering from the ravages of war, became a backdrop to the quiet moments they shared. Amidst the bustling activities of rebuilding and healing, their connection deepened.
They found solace in each other's company, whether it was strolling through the serene gardens of Stormwind Keep or stealing moments of respite in the tranquil corners of the city. The weight of their responsibilities as leaders didn't diminish, but their shared burdens became lighter when carried together.
One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the city, Raynn and Anduin stood on the ramparts of Stormwind Keep. The air was filled with a sense of quietude, a momentary respite from the demands of ruling a kingdom.
Anduin turned to Raynn, his eyes reflecting both weariness and determination. &quot;I never expected this,&quot; he admitted, his voice low.
Raynn nodded, a wistful smile playing on her lips. &quot;Life has a way of surprising us. But sometimes, the unexpected turns out to be exactly what we need.&quot;
He reached for her hand, fingers intertwining naturally. &quot;I feel like I can breathe, even in the midst of all this chaos. Having you by my side... it makes a difference.&quot;
Raynn squeezed his hand gently, the unspoken understanding passing between them. &quot;We're navigating uncharted waters, Anduin. But we're doing it together.&quot;
Their relationship remained discreet, a private sanctuary amid the public responsibilities they carried. As they faced challenges both political and personal, their shared moments of vulnerability became the foundation of their connection.
Anduin, known for his diplomacy and grace, found a different kind of strength in Raynn. Her resilience, born from a history filled with trials, became a source of inspiration. In her, he found someone who understood the weight of leadership and the sacrifices it demanded.
Raynn, in turn, discovered a depth of compassion in Anduin that transcended his royal duties. His empathy and unwavering optimism became a balm for the wounds she carried from her past. Together, they complemented each other, forging a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and an unspoken love that continued to grow.
One evening, under the starlit sky of Stormwind, Anduin invited Raynn to a quiet corner of the garden. The air was fragrant with the scent of blooming flowers as they sat on a stone bench, the soft glow of lanterns casting a warm ambiance.
&quot;I've been thinking,&quot; Anduin began, his gaze fixed on the starry sky. &quot;About us. About what we mean to each other.&quot;
Raynn looked at him, her heart echoing the unspoken sentiments. &quot;And what have you concluded?&quot;
Anduin turned to her, a sincerity in his eyes. &quot;I don't want to hide what we have. I want the world to know.&quot;
Raynn considered his words, the vulnerability in his gaze resonating with hers. After a moment, she nodded. &quot;I feel the same way, Anduin. We've faced darkness together. It's time to step into the light.&quot;
And so, beneath the starlit sky, Anduin and Raynn made a silent promise to face the future together, openly acknowledging the love that had quietly blossomed in the aftermath of war. The journey ahead was uncertain, but with hands entwined, they were ready to navigate the complexities of love, leadership, and the ever-evolving tapestry of their intertwined destinies.
As their relationship became more public, the people of Stormwind started to notice the subtle changes in the dynamics of their leadership. The alliance between Anduin and Raynn was not just political; it was personal, and the citizens found solace in knowing that their leaders shared a connection that went beyond the surface.
The couple continued to face the challenges of their respective roles with a united front. The burdens of the crown weighed heavily on Anduin, but Raynn became his confidante, a steady presence in the storm of responsibilities. Together, they navigated the delicate balance between duty and personal happiness.
One day, in the midst of a council meeting, Anduin glanced at Raynn, a silent acknowledgment passing between them. It was a look that spoke of shared understanding and an unspoken agreement to support each other, no matter the circumstances.
Raynn, who had once been a lone warrior wandering the world, found a home in Stormwind, not just within the stone walls of the keep, but in the heart that beat beside hers. Anduin, in turn, discovered a love that transcended the boundaries of politics and royalty, a love that grounded him in the midst of the ever-changing political landscape.
Their love story became an inspiration, a symbol of hope for a war-weary world. Anduin's advisors, once wary of the implications of a romantic involvement, gradually recognized the strength that the relationship brought to the king. Raynn's years of experience and battle-hardened wisdom became an invaluable asset to the throne.
The people of Stormwind watched with a mixture of curiosity and admiration as their king and his partner faced the challenges of leadership with a newfound resilience. The once private moments between Anduin and Raynn, stolen in the quiet corners of the city, became shared experiences visible to all.
As they strolled through the city streets, the citizens would nod in approval, and the whispers of gossip turned into expressions of support. The love that had quietly blossomed between a warrior and a king became a beacon of hope, a testament to the enduring power of connection in a world fraught with uncertainty.
Their wedding, a grand celebration attended by leaders from across Azeroth, marked a new chapter in their lives. The ceremony, held in the majestic Cathedral of Light, was a union not just of two individuals but of alliances and ideals. Anduin and Raynn exchanged vows that spoke of love, commitment, and a shared vision for a brighter future.
The newlyweds continued to lead Stormwind with wisdom and compassion, their love story intertwined with the history of Azeroth. Together, they faced the challenges of a world in constant flux, finding strength in each other and proving that even in the midst of chaos, love could endure.
And so, the tale of Anduin Wrynn and Raynn Tanner became a legend—a story whispered among the citizens of Stormwind, passed down through generations as a reminder that, in the face of darkness, love could be the greatest force for change.

            <Synopsis>Varian apologizes to Carolyn</Synopsis>
            <Text>As quiet fell once more in the garrison, Bryna conjured another round of magical refreshment for herself and Carolyn. The priestess gratefully accepted, her face drawn. Varian noticed, and concern creased his brow. At Carolyn’s compressed lips and narrowed eyes however, he bowed his head in apology. Striding towards them, he went to one knee in front of the seated priestess.
“I apologize.” His voice was rough and his breathing heavy from the recent combat, but his words rang true. “I lose myself to my rage.” Frustration flashed in his eyes.
Carolyn softened somewhat, nodding in understanding. But while she knew that the frustration was just feeding his rage and lost control even more, she was drained from the effort of healing the unarmored King. A smile played at her lips as she teased, “Perhaps you could find a shield somewhere.”
As he rose, Varian smiled gratefully, and reached out a hand to help her up. It was strange, Carolyn thought, how quickly she had become accustomed to the King as a man. Having to heal someone did that though.</Text>

            <Title>Assassins Foiled</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Lescovar and Marzon defeated
- disposal of bodies</Synopsis>
            <Text>As his prey fell, Elthas pushed back the feline instinct once more. Useful in battle, but he had found that feeding afterwards often disturbed those around him. Especially when the prey was sentient. As the adrenaline of combat faded, the instincts also died down, and he sat back to clean his paws.
Raynn and Kamery were busy wrestling the bodies of their foes over to the bushes, where they might not be found for a while. Bryna stopped them, pointing instead to the far side of the courtyard, where the open arches smelled of fresh air. Padding over ahead of the others, he saw that the courtyard directly overlooked a lake, the white stone wall leading straight down into deep water.
“Convenient,” Raynn agreed, when she reached the far walkway. She and Kamery returned to their task, picking up Lescovar between them. Pondering, Elthas shifted into bear form and shuffled over to stand in their way.
Kamery understood his intention instantly. She was good at that, he realized. Perhaps even better than Carolyn. “Put him on El’s back,” she instructed Raynn, and the warrior heaved the man’s shoulders over the bear’s head. Once the weight was settled, Elthas lumbered carefully over to the edge. Bryna and Carolyn awaited, and helped deliver his grisly burden to its watery resting place. The assassin Marzon soon followed.
Knowing that the guards would return soon, and not wanting to be found at the scene, even with the evidence disposed of, the group quickly left the peaceful courtyard. Shifting back to feline form, Elthas reflected that he should visit the Stormwind Park soon. It was somewhere on the other side of the city, near the Mage District. He had spotted it across the canal as they had approached the Stockade in that area. But first, they had to report back to Trias, in his shop filled with so many interesting smells. His whiskers twitched in anticipation.</Text>

            <Title>Memory</Title>
            <Text>As the first watchtower came into sight, Raynn led them off of the road to the north, cutting across the countryside to the banks of a narrow stream. They forded easily, although Elthas shook off the water uncomfortably afterwards; the water had been too shallow for him to shift to sea lion.
Tarren Mill lay just ahead. After approaching carefully from behind a large barn, they made their way to the inn. There, they found Taretha, bound by Infinite magic. Even Bryna was confounded by the strange bonds. From outside, an unearthly laugh startled them.
“Thrall, come and face your fate!” taunted the Infinite dragon responsible for this incursion into the time-way. His voice held an odd timbre, the sound seeming to shimmer and echo. “Taretha’s life hangs in the balance.”
That was all Thrall needed to hear. He charged out of the inn, Raynn following quickly. She arrived just in time to raise her shield and block worst of the dark, shimmering dragon’s breath attack. It wasn’t enough, and she felt a searing pain in her sword arm.
A moment later though, the warm surge of Carolyn’s healing magic worked its way through her, mending the damage. She swung her sword again, feeling Thrall to her left doing the same.
Fighting next to him, the old habits came back, and she easily melded her moves with his, their swords swinging in an easy rhythm. Behind the dragon, Elthas and Kamery worked on its flanks. She knew that they had found a similar partnership in previous fights with closer quarters. Thrall, she suspected, would never attack a foe from behind. He, like her, preferred to face his enemies head-on.
The Infinite dragon roared in pain, faltering under the onslaught. In addition to their swords, daggers, and claws, it was also wracked with Kamery’s poisons and pelted with Bryna’s bolts of frost. Thrall’s final swing finished it off. The dragon collapsed, then disintegrated in a shower of multi-colored sparks.
Thrall immediately turned back to the inn, where Taretha had been held captive. The blonde woman emerged, with Erozion walking behind her, in Quel’dorei guise.
“Thrall! I’m so glad to see you safe!” Taretha ran forward to greet the Orc.
“I would not be, if not for your friends” Thrall indicated Raynn and her companions.
Taretha frowned in confusion. “I have no idea who these people are,” she began, but a gesture from Erozion froze her and Thrall in place in a swirl of bronze magic.
“I have erased their memories of this event,” the bronze dragon explained to the others. “They will continue to remember things as they should have occurred.”
Raynn’s heart sank, even as she understood the reasoning. It did explain why Thrall hadn’t seemed to know her when they did eventually meet, she realized, as Erozion returned them to their own time.</Text>

            <Title>Onyxia Revealed</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Reach throne room
- Windsor reads incantation from his notes; Onyxia revealed
- Onyxia kills Windsor
- Onyxia's hold on Fordragon is broken</Synopsis>
            <Text>Following behind Varian as he strode into the throne room, Carolyn took a moment to absorb the grandiose audience chamber. Built from the same white marble as the rest of the keep, the octagonal room was enormous. Pillars of darker marble flanked walls festooned with royal blue banners and draperies.
A low dais filled the middle of the room; at its rear stood the throne of Stormwind. Behind the blue-draped, gilded marble seat hung the lion banner of Stormwind. To either side of the throne, doorways led deeper into the Keep, and Carolyn felt her sister’s presence, although she couldn’t see Kamery.
Myriad expensive perfumes tickled Carolyn’s nose, coming from the richly clad nobles gathered in the alcoves between pillars. A murmur of whispers scurried around the room at Varian’s appearance; his face, beneath the scars, was an exact mirror of the man he now faced.
The beautiful, dark-haired woman at the right hand of the man standing in front of the throne was scowling angrily at the moment. Her expression darkened even more as Varian approached, his steps quickly closing the distance to his doppelganger. Windsor paced the King at his left side, and Raynn took his right flank. Carolyn followed behind the three, with Bryna and Jaina to either side of her.
“What is the meaning of this?” the paladin standing on the other Varian’s left side demanded sternly, his suspicious gaze fixed on Varian. Carolyn realized that he must be Bolvar Fordragon, and at the moment, he didn’t sound particularly supportive.
“This man is an impostor,” declared the woman, presumably Lady Katrana Prestor.
Marshal Windsor wasted no time on pleasantries, however. Drawing his notes from his belt pouch, he began reciting the draconic spell that he had transcribed within. Prestor’s face twisted with rage, and something else, as the words fell.
As Carolyn closed her eyes in a moment of silent prayer, she felt the weight of Windsor’s words to her the night before. While the others had relaxed after dinner, the Marshal had drawn her to one side.
‘If my translations are correct,” he had told her gravely, “I will not survive this coming day. There will be nothing you can do, before or after. I accept this.”
Opening her eyes in acknowledgment of his sacrifice, she watched as Windsor completed the incantation, and Katrana Prestor’s guise fell away. As the woman grew and stretched and twisted into a massive black dragon, Windsor’s entire body burst into flame from within. The transformation only took a few seconds, but by the time it was complete, Windsor was gone. Carolyn’s heart ached, even as she took in the scene they now faced.
Looming over the throne stood a creature far larger than any of the drakes Carolyn had encountered before. The dragon’s horned head almost brushed the ceiling of the large room as she reared up, spreading her leathery black wings. The smell of smoke and ash filled the room. Darkly gleaming obsidian scales covered the dragon’s body, and her four feet were tipped with razor-sharp black claws.
Onyxia roared with rage; her voice was a command, and around the room, several of the courtiers and guardsmen similarly transformed into dragonspawn. With the hindquarters of a small dragon, and a humanoid torso, they were fearsome creatures. Light armor covered their obsidian scales and they wielded wicked polearms. Glowing red eyes fixed on the small group clustered at the edge of the dais as the dragonspawn converged. From the connecting hallways, several more dragonspawn rushed in at their brood-mother’s call, their claws clattering ominously against the marble tiles.
As the dragon had transformed, those closest to Lady Prestor had stumbled back from the growing threat. Both Varians were now struggling to regain their footing on the right side of the dais. Beyond them, Bolvar Fordragon had tripped and fallen off the edge of the dais. He rose now, drawing his sword at the threat. Although the paladin moved to stand protectively to Carolyn’s right side, he looked a little befuddled.
At Windsor’s sacrifice, Raynn’s face had hardened. Now she adjusted to the new circumstances, taking the Marshall’s place on Carolyn’s left side. Her sword and shield were at the ready as she placed herself protectively between Onyxia and the spell-casters. Bryna and Jaina had closed together behind Carolyn, and she took a few steps forward onto the dais, to give them room to retreat. Both were now employing the full extent of their frost magic to slow the oncoming attackers.
Ahead of Carolyn to the right, the two Varians regained their footing, and faced off against each other. Both drew their weapons. Their attention seemed more on each other than on the black dragon threatening them all.</Text>

            <Title>The Prince in Danger</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Onyxia threatens Anduin
- Both Varians jump in the way to protect him
- Both Varians are caught in Onyxia's spell
- Raynn pulls Anduin clear, and holds onto him</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Anduin ran across in front of her, just under the swing of Onyxia’s claws, Raynn’s shield slipped in her surprise. Luckily, the Prince’s impulsive intervention also took the dragon by surprise, and she paused her attack to consider the blond boy.
Realizing his danger, Raynn renewed her attack, slamming her shield into the massive beast’s shoulder, but Onyxia ignored it. Wide-eyed, Raynn watched as the dragon drew in a deep breath, preparing a devastating assault.
Anduin’s impassioned plea had caught the attention of both Varians though, startling them enough to stop their impending clash.
“You shouldn’t be fighting each other,” the boy argued, gesturing emphatically with one hand to the dragon behind him.
Onyxia’s head reared back, dark magical energy coalescing in her opened mouth. Recognizing the danger, the two Kings stepped forward. They stood shoulder to shoulder now, to face the dragon. Her focus was on Anduin though, and she unleashed a blast of magical energy.
“NO!” Varian’s shout was anguished. Raynn wasn’t certain which of the two men had yelled. Perhaps they both had, as both now leaped in front of the dragon’s attack. As the dark energy struck them, the two Varians seemed to be pulled together in some sort of vortex. Anduin was buffeted and tossed into the air.
Launching herself forward, Raynn caught hold of the Prince, pulling him protectively close as her momentum carried them into a roll past the two Kings. She rose to one knee, Anduin finding his feet in front of her, as they watched as Onyxia’s spell enveloped both Varians in shadow.
“No,” Anduin’s voice broke as he reached out, but Raynn held him firmly. Whatever was happening to his fathers, it would do him no good to be caught in it himself. A brief flash of memory struck her, of being in the same situation herself, watching from concealment as her parents died. She bowed her head, resting her cheek on the boy’s blond hair in commiseration as he sagged in her arms.</Text>

            <Title>Sneaking through Alcaz</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Aerial surveillance reveals magic circle
- Kamery and Elthas investigate Alcaz Island in stealth
- Elthas identifies split trails, both dead ends to sea though</Synopsis>
            <Text>Elthas broke the surface of the water in the shadows of the small dock on Alcaz Island. The dock led to the only accessible break in the steep cliffs that formed the edges of the small landmass. Beside him, Kamery surfaced, drawing in a slow breath. He had been worried about her ability to make the long swim out to the island, staying below the water to avoid the prying eyes of the Defias, but she had surprised them all. Just as they entered the water, the rogue had pulled out a sparkling blue potion and quaffed it. “Water breathing,” she had grinned proudly. She had easily followed him along the ocean floor.
Elthas could feel the vibrations of the rogue’s heartbeat pounding in the water, and knew that his own likely matched the accelerated pace. Gliding closer to the shore, he used his flippers to pull himself out of the water beneath the rough wooden dock. He made sure he was completely clear before shifting into feline form, so he didn’t get his fur wet. Kamery joined him, crouching in the shadows, almost invisible in her black leather. Her damp hair clung to her head more closely than usual, but it was short and would dry quickly; Elthas grimaced inwardly thinking about how long it took his own waist-length locks to dry.
Ruffling her hair with one hand to speed the process, Kamery gestured with the other. Elthas followed her out from under the dock, happy enough to have the more experienced infiltrator leading the way. Curiosity kills the cat. He cringed as Carolyn’s teasing expression drifted through his mind. He pushed it away. It wasn’t just his own life at stake now; he had to make sure that Kamery returned to her sister as well.
Following Kamery’s lead, they crept up the wide trail leading to the valley at the center of the island. As Cassa had seen, there were several ramshackle buildings around the edges, with a rune circle in the open space between them. Across from the trail to the dock, a dark shadow seemed to be some sort of entrance to an underground area. Naga slithered across the area in pairs, one male and one female. Their movements looked random, but Kamery seemed to find some sort of pattern to it. With a light touch to Elthas’s shoulder, she led the way between the patrols, druid and rogue holding the shadows tight around themselves.
As they approached the rune circle, Elthas’s whiskers twitched; powerful magic had been worked here recently. An unfamiliar scent, like musty charcoal, wrinkled his muzzle in distaste. He suppressed the urge to growl. The scent grew stronger suddenly, no longer old and stale, but fresh. Elthas nudged Kamery urgently, as a rustle came from the undergrowth.
The rogue understood immediately, and he felt her assessing the situation swiftly. Turning, she led them in a zig-zag to the dark hole in the ground that he had noticed earlier. A rough wooden ramp led down into a tunnel, which was thankfully free of Naga. Crouching just below the level of the ground, they turned to watch as a massive black-scaled drake wound its way out from the jungle behind one of the buildings. A crest of what looked like heated rock ran down the back of its head to midway down its back, and its wingtips and four feet were tipped with razor sharp talons. The Naga ignored the creature as it stretched its leathery reddish-black wings and took to the sky.
Elthas felt himself cowering, and was somewhat mollified that Kamery’s hand in his fur had tightened almost painfully tightly in a reflection of the rogue’s own reaction. He heard he draw a slow, deliberate breath, and her hand relaxed, giving him a small, apologetic pat. Elthas leaned lightly against her in acceptance. The drake’s scent was dissipating, but slowly. Turning, he peered down into the tunnel below them, then gave Kamery a questioning glance.
The rogue read his question easily, and nodded. Together, they descended the short ramp and came out in a short, rough tunnel. A set of metal bars a few meters down the tunnel turned the end of it into a makeshift prison cell. Kamery led the way swiftly, already reaching for her lock-picks. Elthas perked up; they had come looking for signs of a prisoner, and this was a good start.
Unfortunately, it also seemed like a dead end, as the cell was empty. Kamery opened it anyway, and he padded inside to investigate, his whiskers twitching eagerly. There had been a Human held here, not too long ago, but not for very long. Picking up the trail, he followed it back to the ramp, Kamery following silently.
At the top of the ramp, the Human scent mingled with the black drake, but the drake’s scent was fading, and now he knew what to look for. The trail led right to the middle of the rune circle, and with Kamery’s occasional touch guiding him away from Naga, he led the way there. Another pair of golden manacles lay open and discarded at one side of the circle; the scent he was tracking was strong on them, but not wanting to draw attention, he left them untouched.
The Naga were avoiding the circle itself, which Elthas decided was a good thing. The scent was confusing here—it seemed to split apart into two directions. One led through the manacles and out to the edge of the jungle, while the other led down the trail to the dock. They could follow the dock trail as they left, he decided, so with a motion of his head, he indicated the other direction to Kamery.
They reached the jungle edge behind one of the low wooden buildings without incident, and he picked up the trail again. Behind a tree, up a short hill, and then…it disappeared abruptly at the edge of a cliff. Frowning, Elthas backtracked, checking carefully to make sure it didn’t split again, or take another turn. Kamery watched him from the shadow of a tree at the cliff’s edge, her expression curious but patient.
She had been following him a long time without explanation, he realized, and padded back to join her in the shadows. After checking around with all his senses for Naga or other danger, he shifted out of form, crouching low beside the rogue. He no longer had the same pull on the shadows as he had in feline form, but he knew that his brown leathers and dusky violet skin would meld well with the shadows, so long as he stayed still.
“A prisoner,” he kept his voice low, easier in this form, which was one reason for the shift. “Human. The trail”—he frowned, unsure how to explain it—“it split, went in two directions.”
Kamery nodded. “One led here?” Her voice was barely a breath.
“It ends at the cliff edge.” Elthas shrugged helplessly.
The rogue glanced down the side of the cliff to the deep water below, then returned her attention to him. “The other?”
“It seemed to head back to the docks. I’ll follow it when we leave.”
Kamery nodded tightly. “We should. I don’t want to be here when that drake returns.”
Nodding his agreement, Elthas shifted back to feline form, drawing the comfortable shadows around himself again.
The second branch of the prisoner’s trail led to the docks, as he had suspected. It disappeared at the end of the slightly uneven pier. As they slipped off the end of the structure, a rustle of wings overhead heralded the return of the firemane drake.
Swiftly, the pair ducked below the dock. Kamery quaffed another water-breathing potion, and they headed back to Theramore to report their findings.</Text>

            <Text>Kamery nodded, falling in beside the King. “We had investigated your disappearance some time ago. Have you remembered anything more of the abduction?”
The King frowned. “How did you know I had lost my memory? What have you discovered?” His tone carried the weight of authority.
“When you returned to Stormwind—” Kamery began, but he cut her off abruptly.
“I haven’t returned to Stormwind yet. The man on the throne now is an impostor.” He took in their shock with an assessing glance, and seemed to make a decision. “The Black Dragonflight is involved, but we don’t know how deeply. We need Windsor’s research before we can risk a confrontation.”
From Kamery’s other side, Carolyn mused, “Perhaps that’s why we were told to avoid the city.”
From where he walked behind them with Raynn, the druid, Broll overheard, and asked, “What is your purpose here then?”
Kamery spread her hands helplessly. “We don’t know. Shaw only told us to come here.”</Text>

- Anduin has told Magni that feels something is “amiss” about his father, but can’t say what (Varian heard second-hand from Magni)
- Anduin has requested further investigation into his father’s abduction; Varian agreed, but Prestor intercepted and had him assign one of her own agents rather than SI:7 (unknown to anyone here)
- Magni has enlisted the aid of Marshal Windsor; Windsor has concluded that the Varian in Stormwind may be a dragon impostor
- Magni has told this to Varian/Broll/Valeera; not wanting to endanger Anduin by a premature confrontation, they seek out Windsor themselves
- As they are leaving Ironforge, a black dragon agent attacks Varian; Valeera subdues him, but succumbs to demonic influence/magic withdrawal/whatever

            <Text>Meanwhile, anticipating the imminent arrival of the King—their King—Kamery and Mathias Shaw crouched in the shadows at a side entrance to the throne room of Stormwind Keep. As they watched as a breathless city guard lieutenant entered the room and strode across to the three standing before the throne.
“Reginald Windsor and the impostor have entered the city,” the man reported.
Lady Prestor’s face grew stormy. “Gather your forces and arrest them. Execute them if they resist.”
Beside her, King Varian stirred. His placid features hardened, reminding Kamery more of the Varian that she knew. “No,” he spoke firmly to the lieutenant. “Return to your post.” 
At Prestor’s frown, the King chided her, “You are not in charge of Stormwind, Lady. The chain of command must be obeyed.”
Before the Lady had a chance to respond, heavy footsteps heralded the arrival of the other Varian and his entourage.</Text>

            <Text>As Elthas made his way to the heart of Darnassus, the towering trees embraced him in a leafy canopy. His druid master, an elder Kaldorei with a deep connection to the land, awaited in the Cenarion Enclave. The druidic teachings and communion with nature were essential to Elthas' growth, and he spent weeks immersed in the ancient wisdom, refining his abilities as a guardian of the wild.

Meanwhile, Carolyn's anticipation surged as she entered the city of Darnassus. The Moonsaber stables, nestled in a tranquil glade, beckoned her with promises of a bond forged between rider and mount. The majestic creatures grazed peacefully, their coats shimmering in the moonlight filtering through the dense foliage.

After a brief exchange with the stable master, Carolyn found herself atop a graceful Moonsaber. The bond was instant, and together they moved with a harmonious grace that spoke of a deep connection. As they explored the quiet corners of Darnassus and the serene landscapes beyond, Carolyn marveled at the sense of freedom and unity she now shared with her newfound companion.

In Stormwind, Kamery navigated the bustling streets, making her way to SI:7 headquarters. Mathias Shaw greeted her with a nod, recognizing the efficiency and skill she brought to their clandestine operations. Together, they delved into reports, whispers, and covert missions, keeping a watchful eye on the shadows that threatened the Alliance.

On the other hand, Bryna's teleportation antics came to a halt as she realized the thrill of solo exploration could not replace the camaraderie of a well-coordinated team. Restless and craving the shared victories of adventuring, she decided to seek out her companions once more.

As destinies converged, Elthas, Carolyn, Kamery, and Bryna found themselves drawn back together, their paths crossing once more in a shared journey that awaited them. United by bonds forged in the crucible of adventure, their stories continued to unfold across Azeroth's vast landscapes.</Text>

            <Title>Kamery sent to Tanaris</Title>
            <Synopsis>Kamery returns to Shaw, but he thinks she needs more combat experience before venturing deeper into Dark Iron territory. Shaw tells her that her sister is in Tanaris, and suggests that they venture into Un'Goro Crater to further hone their skills. Kamery travels by boat from Booty Bay to Steamwheedle Port</Synopsis>
            <Text>Across the ocean from the Shimmering Flats, Kamery stood once more in Mathias Shaw’s round office in Stormwind. Shaw stood at his usual spot by the window, looking out over the city, as she delivered her report. She knew that he was listening intently though, as she told him of the disarray of the Dark Iron Dwarves in the Badlands. Her left thigh still ached slightly, but it was bearable now. Once again, she thought longingly of her priestess sister.
“Good job.” Shaw nodded, turning to her with a pleased smile. “You’ve come a long way, Kamery. Unfortunately, the Dark Irons are a lot more firmly established closer to home.” His smile shifted, becoming more enigmatic. “It will take more than a single agent to disrupt their mining operations in the Searing Gorge.”
Kamery nodded. Her recent foray had pushed her to her limits, and that had just been a small, far-flung outpost. SI:7 agents occasionally worked in small groups, she knew, but she also had a flare of hope that perhaps Shaw would ask her to contact Carolyn again. The SI:7 master had no compunction about using their sisterly relationship to his advantage.
Shaw wasted no time confirming her hope, “Your sister should be in Tanaris soon.”
Kamery blinked in surprise. How did he know where Carolyn was going? Where exactly was Tanaris?
Laying a comforting hand on her shoulder, Shaw led Kamery to the staircase leading down out of his office. “Let’s have a look in the strategy room.”
They descended the spiraling first flight of stairs, to the second floor of the headquarters. A large planning room opened out to their right, with a detailed map of the world permanently affixed to the large table in the room’s center.
Shaw’s fingers traced as he spoke. “Carolyn was last seen here, in the Thousand Needles. She and Elthas were heading east. Unless they double back and head north into the Barrens, they’ll reach the Shimmering Flats in a few days. From there, the only option is to turn south to Tanaris. Gadgetzan is a Goblin city built at the pass into the desert. They’ll likely stay there for a little while at least.”
Kamery considered that, trying to follow Shaw’s thinking, putting his information together with what she knew of her sister. Carolyn was stubbornly determined, Kamery knew, so the idea of turning back from a path and retracing her steps was indeed unlikely. Combined with Elthas’s love of exploration, it did make sense that the two would continue east through Thousand Needles.
“You want me to go there?” she asked, trying to keep her voice neutral.
The warm tone in Shaw’s voice told her that she hadn’t succeeded, but it didn’t matter. “Yes.” His fingers moved again, this time to the Eastern Kingdoms. “You can fly to Booty Bay from here quickly, then I’ve arranged a swift cutter to take you across to Steamwheedle Port, in Tanaris. It’s a short ride to Gadgetzan. You should arrive within a week.”
Kamery’s eyes widened at the time-frame. To cross the ocean in less than a week was impressive. She counted days. She might still miss them, if they didn’t stay long. “If I miss them?”
“Find them.” Shaw’s order was emphatic. His fingers moved across the map, to the mountain just east of Stormwind. “Blackrock Mountain is stirring. Between the Dark Iron, the Orcs, and the Elementals, we’ll need your group.”
The spy-master gave Kamery a level look. “You’re not ready yet,” he stated bluntly. “When you do find them, spend some more time together. Gain more experience in the world.”
Kamery accepted the assessment with a nod. “You’ll send word again?”
Shaw nodded, his hand moving again across the map. “Raynn was seen passing through Booty Bay. She boarded the ship to Ratchet. See if you can find her in Kalimdor, after you find your sister.”
Kamery’s eyes followed the spy-master’s hands, taking in all the new locations and unfamiliar place names. One member of their group still hadn’t been mentioned yet. “What of Bryna?”
“I’ve lost track of Bryna.” Shaw sounded disgruntled. “Mages are difficult.”
Remembering the array of portals from the Arathi Highlands, Kamery had to agree. Bryna had found their time together interesting though, so perhaps she would get bored again, and seek them out. Bryna’s parting words echoed in Kamery’s mind, ‘This isn’t the end.’</Text>

            <Notes>Shaw has quite the network of informants, with instant communication. He heard of Carolyn and Elthas’s passage through Thousand Needles from the Tauren there - although perhaps not directly (some sort of agreement with Horde intelligence agencies). He also has several informants among the Steamwheedle Cartel (likely just buying information).</Notes>

            <Synopsis>- Raynn and Kamery leave to deliver reports</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kamery stood for a moment, watching Raynn walk away. The warrior’s armor glinted in the sunlight. Her stride was firm and even, without the slightest hint of nervousness at the prospect of meeting the King. Curiously, Kamery turned to her sister. Carolyn was also watching Raynn, with a more speculative look than Kamery was used to seeing without looking in a mirror.
Sensing her sister’s gaze, Carolyn turned to Kamery and raised an eyebrow. “She’s confident.” Her tone made it an explanation and a question all at once. Kamery knew that due to their usual roles in combat, her sister and the warrior had needed to work well together; Raynn could confidently draw their foes’ attention, knowing that her wounds would be mended by Carolyn’s healing power. Carolyn, in turn, could focus on healing, without needing to worry about her own safety. The relationship between warrior and healer was often close bond, but perhaps they hadn’t known each other for long enough yet.
“She’s not from around here.” Surprisingly, it was Elthas who provided the answer, with a smooth transition from sleek panther to handsome, blue-haired Kaldorei. He looked down at them from his new height, and an almost-feline shiver ran across his muscular arms. Kamery dragged her eyes up from examining the runes visible under his light leather vest at eye level, to look inquiringly into his glowing golden eyes.
Elthas hadn’t seemed to notice her momentary lapse. He was staring over her head, still watching Raynn. Kamery glanced over her shoulder to see the warrior disappear around a corner, her long auburn ponytail swinging freely behind her.
“She feels like... Kalimdor.” Elthas’s aquiline nose wrinkled, as if remembering taking in the warrior’s scent as a panther. “More though. I can’t tell it all apart.” His features twisted apologetically, and he dropped back into his more familiar form.
Kamery gave him an appreciative smile. “That’s more than I could tell,” she admitted. “I can see why Shaw is intrigued.”
“Speaking of,” Carolyn gently reminded her.
“Yes, I’d better report all this back to him.” Kamery turned to go, then half-turned back. “You’ll be alright here?” Although they had grown up just outside the city, she knew that Carolyn had only come to Stormwind a few times before she had left for Darnassus. The winding cobblestone streets could be confusing, and the criss-crossing canals that separated the various districts even more so.
A soft snort answered her concern, reminding her of the fourth person standing with them. With that hat, how could I forget she’s there? Invisibility spell? Kamery smiled, relieved. “Sorry Bryna, of course they’ll have you.”
“Come on,” Bryna invited, “Let’s go visit my folks. Maybe get you a new robe, or a vest!” She smiled as she looked over Carolyn’s less than pristine white robes.
Her sister was in good hands, Kamery decided, and turned away, already carefully considering her words for Shaw. I may work for him, but I also know the value of keeping secrets.</Text>

            <Title>Assembling in Theramore</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Everyone is gathered in Theramore
- Bryna arrives with the Amulet
- Row/sea lion across to Wyrmbog</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Bryna rejoined the group, Elthas’s feline ears perked up from where he lay on the sunny grass near one of the white stone sentry towers that guarded Theramore’s large, deep harbor. Nearby, his friends also waited, standing on the wooden boardwalk that lined the waterfront.
At the easternmost of the three long piers, a trio of shallow-draft longboats waited, ready to carry them across Tidefury Cove to the Wyrmbog, where Onyxia’s lair lay. Looking dubiously at the narrow rowboats, Elthas was glad he could swim across himself.
Joining him for the swim would be Broll, the elder druid having returned from the Moonglade in time to join their venture. He now stood in Kaldorei form beside Varian.
Forming a third point of a triangle with the two was a slender female Sin’dorei rogue, who had been introduced as Valeera. With long, loose, blonde hair, and a red leather bodysuit paired with tall boots and long gloves, she was as bright as Kamery was dark. Varian and Broll had spoken highly of her combat ability, and her green eyes shone alert and eager.
The trio looked up as Bryna and Jaina Proudmoore joined them. The arch-mage had waited for Bryna in her study. Bryna’s eyes and satisfied smile found Elthas and their friends first, where they stood slightly apart from the Human King and his friends.
Varian was no longer the same rough warrior that they had accompanied into the depths of Blackrock Mountain; that had only been half of the Human, and far from his throne. Broll and Valeera seemed more comfortable with him, but they had known Lo’Gosh for longer.
Elthas and his friends hadn’t had a chance to get to know this new Varian. After the unveiling of Onyxia in Stormwind, the Human King had been occupied repairing the damage to his kingdom, while Elthas and his friends had repaired Bolvar Fordragon’s amulet.
The paladin was also with them, standing further along the boardwalk, already ready to board the boat that would bring him to confront the dragon who had muddled his mind for so long. Kamery had told them that Varian had asked Fordragon to remain in Stormwind, to serve as regent once more, but the paladin had been insistent on facing the dragon himself.
Mathias Shaw had been pressed into service as temporary regent for the young Prince Anduin instead. Remembering the Human Prince’s inquisitive nature, Elthas wondered if SI:7 would have any secrets left by the time they returned.
Thoughts of return would come later though, he reminded himself, as the group moved towards the low boats. First, they had to defeat the Black Dragonflight’s brood-mother. As he slipped into the murky water, shifting smoothly into sea lion form, he felt the adrenaline beginning to build.
The swim was a short one, and the low boats landed near a twisting path that led up into the hills, and then down into the Wyrmbog. The Black Dragonflight’s influence was immediately apparent. Twisted, blackened skeletons were all that remained of the low trees that had once grown in this area. The ground was soft underfoot, with every footprint filling with water as they walked. The air was gritty with a hazy smoke, overpowering the earthy smell of the bog.</Text>

            <Title>25-06-L30-Four without Raynn - levelling in Wetlands and Arathi</Title>
            <Text>As Carolyn, Elthas, Bryna, and Kamery journey through the Wetlands and Arathi Highlands, they face various challenges and adversaries. Along the way, they encounter remnants of the Blackrock Orcs and the Syndicate, remnants of the fallen Kingdom of Stromgarde.

In the Wetlands, the group assists the dwarves of Menethil Harbor with defending against the hostile wildlife and ensuring the safety of trade routes. They also uncover a dark plot by the Blackrock Orcs to disrupt the fragile peace in the region, leading to confrontations with orc raiders and their leaders.

Moving into Arathi Highlands, they come across the ongoing conflict between the League of Arathor and the Forsaken, who seek to expand their influence in the region. The group aids the League in repelling the Forsaken incursion, participating in battles and strategic maneuvers.

Throughout their journey, the companions strengthen their bonds, each member showcasing their unique skills and abilities. Kamery's stealth and subterfuge prove invaluable in gathering information, while Bryna's magical prowess aids in overcoming magical defenses. Carolyn's combat skills and Elthas's druidic abilities complement each other, creating a well-rounded team.

As they progress, the group may discover hints of a larger threat looming in the shadows, prompting them to investigate further and uncover the mysteries that await them in the Eastern Kingdoms.

---

The evening sun cast a warm glow over Menethil Harbor as Carolyn, Elthas, Bryna, and Kamery gathered at the local inn after a day of adventuring through the Wetlands and Arathi Highlands. The scent of hearty stew and freshly baked bread wafted through the air as the companions found a corner table to relax.

The room buzzed with conversation as locals and travelers alike shared tales of their own adventures. The innkeeper, a stout dwarf with a braided beard, approached their table with a nod of recognition.

&quot;Back from the wilds, are ye?&quot; he grunted, setting down four tankards of ale. &quot;On the house for the heroes of Menethil!&quot;

Carolyn raised an appreciative eyebrow. &quot;Heroes might be a bit much, but we do our best.&quot;

Laughter rippled through the group as they clinked tankards together before taking sips of the frothy brew. The evening air outside was cool, and the sound of waves lapping against the harbor provided a soothing backdrop.

&quot;So, what's the plan for tomorrow?&quot; Elthas asked, a mischievous glint in his eyes. &quot;More orc-slaying, or perhaps a detour through Arathi's haunted lands?&quot;

Kamery smirked, twirling a dagger between her fingers. &quot;I vote for haunted lands. Maybe we'll stumble upon some buried treasure or an ancient artifact.&quot;

Bryna, her red hat slightly askew, chimed in, &quot;As long as it's not cursed, I'm in.&quot;

The conversation flowed effortlessly, blending plans for the next day's adventure with tales of their encounters. As the night wore on, the inn's atmosphere grew livelier, with a bard strumming a tune in the corner and patrons joining in song.

Amidst the camaraderie, the companions found comfort in each other's company, their bond growing stronger with every shared moment of triumph and laughter. The challenges of the Eastern Kingdoms were many, but in the warmth of the inn, they found respite, unity, and the promise of more adventures on the horizon.</Text>

            <Title>After Hyjal - Jaina</Title>
            <Text>Jaina entered the bustling encampment, the weariness of battle etched on her face. Her gaze swept across the wounded, the diligent medics, and the worn but determined soldiers. She felt the weight of responsibility as the leader of these forces. Among the various faces, her eyes caught sight of a figure seated on a makeshift bed.
Approaching the young girl, Jaina noted her plain attire, a stark contrast to the armor-clad warriors around. The medics had done well; her wounds seemed to have healed, but weariness lingered in her eyes. Jaina studied her for a moment, a hint of curiosity sparking in her gaze.
&quot;Hello there,&quot; Jaina greeted with a warm smile. &quot;I haven't had the chance to properly introduce myself. I'm Jaina Proudmoore.&quot; She extended a hand in greeting.
The girl, still recovering from her injuries, regarded Jaina with a mix of curiosity and wariness. The name seemed to click in her mind, recognition flickering in her eyes. Raynn hesitated for a moment before reaching out to shake Jaina's hand.
&quot;I'm Raynn,&quot; she replied, her voice steady but guarded. &quot;Raynn Tanner.&quot;
Jaina's brows raised slightly. The name held no immediate significance, but there was a story behind those guarded eyes. &quot;It's a pleasure to meet you, Raynn. You've been through quite an ordeal. How are you feeling?&quot;
Raynn's gaze flickered around the encampment, uncertainty lingering in her eyes. &quot;I'm better, thank you. Still getting used to being on my feet again.&quot;
Jaina nodded understandingly. &quot;Take your time. We've been through a lot, and healing is a process. If there's anything you need or if you'd like to talk, I'm here.&quot;
The girl, Raynn, offered a small nod, her guard softening just a fraction. &quot;Thank you, Lady Proudmoore.&quot;
Jaina's gaze lingered on Raynn for a moment longer before she excused herself to attend to other matters. As she navigated through the encampment, she couldn't shake the curiosity about the young warrior and the untold story that seemed to linger in her eyes.</Text>

            <Title>Reports and Discussions</Title>
            <Text>Kamery followed the druid out of the Stockades in a daze. One—small—part of her was alert for danger, as they passed the occupied cells, but the resistance seemed to have faded. She realized that Raynn, striding ahead of them with Thedd’s removed head, might have something to do with that.
Mostly though, her thoughts were whirling at the memory of her sister falling under the man’s assault. Her heart still ached, even though Carolyn was walking easily ahead of them, her robes torn and stained, but otherwise whole. Once the fight had ended, Carolyn had easily healed herself, and the rest of them. Kamery shook her head at her sister’s endurance.
As they climbed the ramp leading out of the prison, she looked down at the druid ahead of her. His whiskers twitched slightly as they traveled, and with a sniff, she realized that the air down here was dank and filled with smells best left unidentified. The metallic scent of blood trailing the warrior ahead also contributed to the unpleasant miasma.
As they emerged, Raynn was already deep in conversation with the Warden. Thelwater looked only slightly mollified, but he accepted Raynn’s burden, and after a few more words, began scribbling out a quick note. Kamery realized that she should be curious, but she was too worried about her sister.
Deciding that Raynn had the matter well in hand, she headed back out into the city streets. The bright light of the sun was a shock after the dim, torch-lit hallways below. Bryna had guided Carolyn over to the edge of the canal near the Stockade entrance, and the two were chatting casually. Kamery strode over, her steps feeling heavier than usual.
Carolyn looked up as she approached, concern on her face. Kamery frowned; she was the one who was supposed to be concerned. Elthas had followed her, and as they reached the other two, he shifted out of feline form. Carolyn hugged the tall Kaldorei, and Kamery was reminded that the two of them had spent most of the past year together. She wondered now if Carolyn’s letters had told her everything. How much of what they had done had her sister left out?
Solid footsteps behind her, with the distinctive ring of metal on stone, told Kamery that Raynn was approaching now too. She shifted slightly, moving closer to Carolyn, and allowing the warrior to join the group.
“What happened?” Raynn spoke with characteristic bluntness.
Carolyn smiled as she answered, her eyes traveling around the group. “Elthas brought me back. It’s a powerful druidic spell. One that I know exhausts him.” Her eyes lingered appreciatively on the tall druid. He ducked his head briefly, acknowledging her words.
Carolyn’s eyes swept over to Kamery as she continued, “I had to keep Raynn alive. If she fell, I wouldn’t have been able to heal anyone else. He hit hard.” Bryna snorted at the understatement.
With a wry glance at the mage, Carolyn explained, “I knew Elthas could do it. I knew he was ready when he shifted.”
Raynn studied the druid for a moment, her direct look making him fidget uncomfortably. “You healed me too, didn’t you?” the warrior asked.
Elthas nodded, and Kamery remembered their encounter in the Deadmines, when she had been injured. Not only had he healed her, but he had used his bear form to protect her. It seemed that every time they fought, she learned a new aspect of the druid. She wondered how many more surprises he had in store. She found herself hoping that she would have an opportunity to find out.
Raynn cleared her throat, releasing Elthas from her gaze as she turned to Kamery. “Thelwater told me about a frequent visitor Thedd has been receiving recently. Thought he was suspicious, but the papers checked out.” Her tone indicated her opinion of Thelwater’s thoroughness. She held out a folded note. “He gave me a name and a description. He suggested we”—her voice, and outstretched hand, indicated that she did not want to be included in that grouping—“consult with Mathias Shaw at SI:7.”
Kamery nodded. A name and description weren’t much to go on, but if anyone could get to the heart of the matter, it would be Shaw. Cringing inwardly, she ignored the outstretched note. Trying to choose her words, and tone, carefully, she informed the reluctant warrior, “You’ll have to report yourself. Shaw will want to hear exactly what Thelwater said.” She shook her head apologetically. “I’m sorry, I was distracted.”
Raynn’s face softened with sympathy, as she glanced at Carolyn. “Of course,” she responded, but then, with a hint of discomfort, she asked, “Could you come with me?” She added in a rush, “You know him.”
Carolyn gave Kamery a small push on her shoulder. “Go on,” she directed. “I’m fine now.”
Once again, Kamery wondered what troubles her sister and Elthas had gotten into in Kalimdor. Carolyn was far too nonchalant for this to have been her first brush with death. Elthas nodded encouragement though, so she nodded to Raynn, and the two set off for Old Town, home of the familiar barracks and headquarters.
It was a short walk, and passed mostly in silence. Kamery was still shaken by seeing her sister fall, and Raynn was wrapped up in her own thoughts.
“Shaw isn’t that bad, once you get to know him.” Kamery broke the silence, as they left the cobblestone streets of Old Town, mounting the short, wide flight of steps up to the lawn that lay between the barracks and SI:7.</Text>

            <Text>Carolyn crossed the open space in front of the Stormwind Cathedral with quiet confidence in her step. The Cathedral Square seemed immune to the bustle that permeated so much of the rest of the city. Despite the people crossing through with businesslike steps or conversing in small groups, the air seemed heavy and the sounds muted. Even the colors were less vibrant; the orderly wooden buildings surrounding the square were painted plain white, between bare oak supports, and they were topped by dull bronze roofs.
The folds of her new robe draped around her comfortingly, the soft silk fabric much finer than anything she had previously owned. Bryna’s parents had been competent and efficient, finding a robe that held just the right amount of enchantment to empower her without being overwhelming. The smooth weave held whispered promises of more potent spells and greater endurance in combat.
The style was impeccable too, with wide bands of deep purple falling over her shoulders and down to the hem of the otherwise white robe. Wide sleeves covered her arms, loose enough to allow movement, but gathered at the wrist so they wouldn’t get in her way. As Bryna’s mother had made the final adjustments for fit, she had given Carolyn some tips on sewing; the priestess couldn’t wait to implement them on her next project.
As Carolyn ascended the wide, white marble steps of the Cathedral, she smiled at the memory of Bryna’s parents’ brisk efficiency. In addition to their exquisite tailoring, they had also been a font of revelation. Carolyn had learned that Bryna had once apprenticed in her parents’ shop, until an instructor from the Tower had recognized her potential. Invited to train as a mage at the young age of fourteen, she had continued working at the shop during her early studies. A little over a year ago, her parents learned the full extent of Bryna’s potential, and had pushed their daughter to commit to her studies full-time.
They had related the story with evident pride, while also fussing over their own daughter. Carolyn felt her throat tighten, thinking of her own parents; they had already been ill when she had begun her priestly studies, and hadn’t had a chance to see her progress. Entering the wide, invitingly open doors of the Cathedral, Carolyn felt peace flow through her, comforting her. While she always felt the Light with her on her adventures, times like this reinforced the feeling, bolstering her spirit as she walked up the central aisle of the nave.
Multicolored light spilled over her as she approached the altar at the front, coming from large stained glass windows extending almost the full height of the walls behind the altar. The faint scent of incense lingered in the air, exotic and familiar at the same time.
Carolyn stopped for a moment of contemplation, allowing her feelings to wash over her and be soothed. Always present, her eyes misted over at the loss of her parents. More immediately, her heart clenched at the lingering memory of her recent fall in the Stockades. Although she had known what would happen—and had known what Elthas was capable of—the feeling was still disquieting.
She allowed the Light to wash the feelings away, and turned her thoughts to more pleasant feelings. It had been wonderful to see Kamery again, and to meet Bryna and Raynn. Venturing through the Deadmines with the group, and then again in Stormwind, had been invigorating. She enjoyed working as part of a group, employing her spells to heal them, while they did all the hard work. Having a particular appreciation for shield-users, she found herself hoping that they hadn’t seen the last of the taciturn warrior.
The lingering feelings faded into calmness and Carolyn’s mind turned to more practical matters. She should seek out the senior priests here, and see if she was ready to learn any new spells. Elthas’s teasing echoing in her mind, she hoped that she was ready to learn how to return a spirit to its body.
Turning to the side, she made her way to the large study hall that ran alongside the main nave of the Cathedral. The feeling of peace persisted, but in here, there was a quiet bustle of activity. Scribes sat at desks copying out texts, while others sat on the benches that lined the room, studying tomes of their own. The musty smell of old books mingled with the sharper scent of fresh ink. Low voices and the rustle of paper pervaded the hall.
At the far end of the study hall, Carolyn spotted the unmistakable figure of Brother Benjamin. The powerful priest was pacing along one of the walls, watching the younger scribes work. She had only met him twice before, but she remembered his firm stride and perpetual motion. He paused briefly, to bend over one scribe’s shoulder and point to a part of the text. The young man flushed, and reached for the small bone knife beside him. Benjamin murmured something, and the scribe nodded, putting the bone knife back down. He looked questioningly up at Benjamin, and the elder priest responded, gesturing to the shelves of books that lined the wall.
Apparently satisfied, Benjamin continued his pacing, as the scribe behind him stood, selected a book from the shelf, and began to read. The priest reached the end of the row of desks, and looking up, he spotted Carolyn, standing in the doorway. A wide smile broke across his face, and his pace picked up as he approached her.
“Carolyn, you’ve returned!” Benjamin exclaimed, earning several shushes from the others in the room. Nearing her, he continued in a lower voice, “How was Darnassus? Tell me, what have you learned from the High Priestess of Elune?”
Flushing, Carolyn admitted, “I didn’t actually stay in Darnassus long. I met a druid and we spent most of the time out in the wilds of Kalimdor.”
Benjamin’s eyes widened at that, as he guided her to a small alcove with two benches. As they seated themselves, he asked, “Is the Light still with you? Or”—a teasing tone entered his gruff voice—“have you turned to druidism now?”
Carolyn laughed, thinking of Elthas’s opinion of her favorite spell. “I did learn this…” She demonstrated the spell with a quick word.
A pleased smile lit up Benjamin’s face, as he told her, “That’s an impressive spell, but a little weak sometimes.”
Nodding, Carolyn broached her reason for coming here. “Something else he can do.” She hesitated for a moment, before blurting out, “I was hoping that you could teach me the resurrection spell.”
Benjamin studied her for a moment. “Are your adventures that dangerous then?” The older priest nodded as he finished his assessment. “Well, I believe you may be ready. The spell requires a deep connection to the Light, but I sense that in you.”
A peaceful smile lit Carolyn face, as she thought back to the moment at the altar.
“When a body falls, the spirit remains within for some time,” Benjamin explained. “Through your connection to the Light, you can sense that spirit. Reconnect it, similar to your healing spells.” He demonstrated the gestures and incantation.
In a whisper, Carolyn tried to echo him. Benjamin gently corrected her, and she tried again. This time, she felt the warmth of the Light surge within her and the older priest nodded.
A new spell in her arsenal, Carolyn thanked Benjamin, and rose to leave. The priest returned to his pacing up and down the long study hall, sending a few of the acolytes scurrying to get back to work.
Laughing, Carolyn left the hall and made her way up the side of the nave. She wondered how Kamery was doing with Shaw, and whether she would see her sister again soon. She hoped so, but also knew that the spy-master kept his agents busy. At least it was for the good of Stormwind, she admitted, but she couldn’t help but wish Kamery would get a short reprieve. Pride in her sister rose in her; she knew that Kamery’s work was dangerous—even more so now that she had been involved in it—but she had faith in her sister’s abilities.
As she rounded the corner to approach the Cathedral’s main doors, Carolyn’s reverie was interrupted by a young boy approaching her. Dressed in the white and red robe of an altar boy, he beckoned her into one of the alcoves beside the doorway.
“Excuse me, Priestess,” he addressed her formally. “I am Thomas. Bishop DeLavey has asked me to approach adventurers that might be able to help him with a delicate matter.”
A shock ran through Carolyn. In her new robes, she didn’t think she looked much like an adventurer anymore. The mention of a ‘delicate matter’ had piqued her curiosity though, so she let Thomas continue.
“If you could quietly head to Stormwind Keep and speak to him at your earliest convenience, I’m sure he would appreciate your help. Again, please be discreet. It is a matter of some importance.”
Quietly? Discreet? Carolyn’s brows furrowed as she absorbed the words, but before she could question the boy, he slipped back out of the alcove and ran back into the Cathedral. Intrigue, she though, was Kamery’s forte. Puzzled, but curious, Carolyn slowly left the Cathedral.
Outside, in the the softening sunlight of the fading afternoon, she was pleased to see a familiar figure lounging at the edge of the Cathedral Square’s central fountain. Dressed in dark leather and a bandanna that covered the lower half of her face, Kamery stood out among the robed priests, but nobody paid her any mind. Carolyn wondered how much of that had to do with the wicked daggers sheathed at her sister’s hips.
“Caro!” Kam crossed the distance between them easily and hugged her sister. Stepping back, she looked Carolyn up and down, taking in the new robe. “Bryna’s parents did well for you! It looks lovely!” Her brow wrinkled though, as she asked, “Are you in any trouble?”
Carolyn considered for a moment. Thomas’s request had been unusual, and the phrasing perhaps indicated that it was more than it sounded, but no, it wasn’t trouble—at least, not yet. She shook her head, assuring Kamery, “No, no trouble.” She lowered her voice. “I’ve been asked to meet with a Bishop at the Keep, quietly.” Speaking it out loud made it seem more ominous.
“I see.” Kamery nodded, easily reading her trepidation. “Let me come with you.”
Her sister’s protectiveness warming her, Carolyn nodded, saying, “Of course. I’d probably get lost on the way anyway.”
Kamery laughed, and led the way out of the Cathedral Square, taking a narrow passage that Carolyn hadn’t even noticed before. They emerged onto one of the many canal-side pathways, and Carolyn tried to get her bearings. Was that the Stockade over there? No, they were facing the wrong direction. Hurriedly, she caught up to Kamery, as the rogue easily made her way along the path and across one of the city’s low bridges. Shortly, the Keep came into sight in the distance.
As they approached, the armored guards at the entrance stood impassively, ready to allow them to pass again, but without Raynn, Carolyn realized that she had no idea where to go. Unless the Bishop was in the courtyard, she would get lost in the criss-crossing hallways. She hoped that the Bishop was not in the courtyard; she didn’t really want to go back there quite yet.
“Excuse me.” She tried to keep her voice steady as she addressed the guard on the right. He was slightly shorter, which made him seem less intimidating. “I’m looking for Bishop DeLavey. Could you please tell me where to find him?”
The guardsman glanced at her, taking in her robes, and gave a short nod as he told her, “The Bishop is usually in the chapel, straight ahead, first door on the left.”
With a pleasant smile, Carolyn thanked him, and she and Kamery entered the Keep. Without Raynn to keep them moving, they took a moment to stop and look around. The entire Keep had been built from gleaming white marble, and the floor was polished to a shine, despite the frequent visitors. Blue and gold cloth festooned the walls, adding warmth to the wide main hallway. She remembered from their previous visit that the walls of the smaller hallways had been lined with paintings, most depicting the landscapes of Stormwind’s territories, or beyond. The main hallway was deserted now, but a faint scent of perfume lingered in the air, a reminder of the nobles who passed through here every day.
Kamery gave Carolyn a nudge, and together the sisters started up the wide hall. They didn’t have far to go, as they came to the indicated door. The wooden portal stood open, allowing warm light to spill out into the hallway. Entering cautiously, she saw that it was a small chapel, lit with flickering candles. Standing to one side of the room stood a man in elaborate Bishop’s vestments.
The man looked up as they entered, taking in Kamery’s black leather and Carolyn’s white-and-purple robes with an expressionless glance. Carolyn swallowed, her mouth dry, but steadied her voice as she asked, “Are you Bishop DeLavey?” At his nod, she continued, “Thomas sent me.” She was aware of Kamery quietly pushing the door half-closed behind her.
At the mention of the altar boy, the Bishop’s demeanor changed immediately, relaxing with relief, as he greeted them, “Well met, priest.” He glanced curiously at Kamery. “I hadn’t expected a member of SI:7.”
“She’s my sister,” Carolyn reassured the man. “She can be discreet as well.”
DeLavey laughed at that, a warm hearty sound. “I’m sure,” he replied. “I’m afraid I don’t have time to elaborate much, so let me be blunt. And please, try to keep this from becoming common knowledge. Recently, a diplomat was sent to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmoore. That diplomat never arrived. I believe the Defias are involved in this plot, but I’m not sure how.”
Carolyn felt her heart skip a beat at the mention of the Defias. How far did their influence stretch? She glanced at Kamery, and saw that her sister’s grey eyes had narrowed.
The Bishop continued, speaking tersely, “This is not yet known to the public, but it can’t remain that way for long. Agents of the King are already scouring the city for clues, but I have my own contacts that I would like involved. In the Valley of Heroes is an old friend of mine, Jorgen. Find him, give him this note, and follow his instructions.”
Pulling a folded note from his pocket, DeLavey handed it to Carolyn. She tucked it into one of the spacious pockets of her new robe. Bryna’s parents had thought of every detail.
Fixing them with a stern look, the Bishop warned, “Be discreet in this matter.”
Kamery didn’t make a sound as she nodded, but Carolyn imagined that she could hear her sister’s snort of derision in her head. Kamery was nothing if not discreet. She hoped that she could emulate her sister.
DeLavey’s warning had been a dismissal, so the sisters left the chapel, moving out of the Keep in silence. Once back on the canal-side path, Kamery started to the left, but stopped abruptly when something caught her eye.</Text>

            <Title>Punctuation</Title>
            <Text>The choice between a comma, semicolon, or em-dash to join phrases depends on the specific nuances you want to convey and the level of separation or connection between the ideas. Here's a brief guide:

1. **Comma (,):**
   - **Usage:** Commas are generally used to link closely related ideas or coordinate elements.
   - **Example:** &quot;She remembered her father's advice, his wisdom guiding her through challenging times.&quot;

2. **Semicolon (;):**
   - **Usage:** Semicolons are employed to connect closely related independent clauses (complete thoughts) without a coordinating conjunction.
   - **Example:** &quot;She was determined to finish the project; the deadline was looming.&quot;

3. **Em-dash (—):**
   - **Usage:** Em-dashes can indicate a strong break or interruption in thought, providing emphasis or introducing an explanatory element.
   - **Example:** &quot;She spoke with confidence—her years of experience evident in every word.&quot;

4. **Conjunctions (and, but, etc.):**
   - **Usage:** Conjunctions like &quot;and,&quot; &quot;but,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; etc., are useful for connecting ideas in a clear and straightforward manner.
   - **Example:** &quot;She enjoyed the challenge, but she knew it would require hard work.&quot;

When deciding, consider the flow and rhythm of your sentences. Commas are often more subtle, while semicolons and em-dashes create a stronger break or emphasis. Choose the punctuation that best suits the tone and pace you want to convey in your writing.</Text>

            <Title>Southshore - Grom2</Title>
            <Text>Grom Hellscream surveyed the Southshore docks, a myriad of emotions swirling within him. Thrall's revelation through Farsight had stirred a sense of urgency—a threat to the human girl, bound by a blood oath, loomed on the horizon. The blood oath. An obligation he had thought fulfilled years ago when they left the child with the dwarves.
As the last of the humans disappeared into the northern horizon, Grom spurred his war wolf toward Raynn. She stood there, a lone figure against the backdrop of an impending unknown. The words spilled from his lips with a gruff determination, &quot;You come with us, human.&quot;
Thrall's nod added weight to Grom's declaration. The blood oath, that sacred promise, echoed in Grom's mind. The girl's hesitation didn't escape him, and he knew clarity was needed.
&quot;The humans will realize your deception soon enough,&quot; he explained, a sternness in his tone. &quot;When they find the orcs have escaped, their anger will turn to you.&quot;
She absorbed his words, considering the impending consequences. In that moment, Grom saw the acceptance in her eyes—the acknowledgment that the Wildhammers wouldn't risk their alliance with the Alliance to shelter her. The burden of a promise made long ago pressed upon him, and her decision to come with them brought a sense of honor.
&quot;I'll go with you,&quot; she declared, her voice steady.
Grom nodded in approval, a sense of responsibility mingling with the relief that the blood oath would be upheld. Time was of the essence, and the situation demanded swift action. As she wrote a note to the Wildhammers, Grom's gaze lingered on her determined form—a human willingly stepping into the unknown with orcs.
Together, Thrall, Raynn, and Grom rode back to Southshore, the looming ships bearing silent witness to the voyage that awaited them. The air crackled with anticipation as they boarded their respective vessels, leaving behind the contentious lands of the Eastern Kingdoms. The orcs set sail, guided by the uncharted waters of the future, while Grom Hellscream felt the weight of a renewed oath and the unspoken complexities of the journey ahead.</Text>

            <Title>The Red Dragon</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Elthas recognizes Vaelan as a dragon
- He tells them where to find the gemstones</Synopsis>
            <Text>Elthas had moved up past Raynn’s left to study Vaelan curiously. The Human wasn’t Human, no more than he had been an Orc a few moments earlier. He radiated powerful magic; magic that Elthas had only seen a few times before—Andormu, Erozion, and Onyxia; he wondered if he would have sensed the same from Haleh.
Shifting out of feline form, he voiced his suspicions. “What Dragonflight are you?”
Vaelan momentarily looked as surprised as Elthas’s companions, then he laughed appreciatively. “You are perceptive. I am of the Red Dragonflight. Vaelastrasz.” He bowed to Elthas. “My natural form would not fit here. I am sure you understand. This”—he indicated his Human form—“is my visage. The other is an illusion, to avoid trouble below.”
Elthas chuckled; he understood completely. He could see Carolyn’s grey eyes crinkle in amusement, even as she blinked, still processing the existence of another Dragonflight.
Only recently, in the Moonglade, had Elthas learned a little more about the various Dragonflights—how they had been the protectors of Azeroth, but had largely distanced themselves from the world as the mortal races grew. The Red Dragonflight were the protectors of life, which explained the sense of vitality radiating from Vaelan.
As his companions absorbed the expanded introduction, Elthas pressed ahead. “You mentioned gemstones of power. Where would we find those?”
Vaelan’s good humor dropped once more. “What is it you seek, beyond Drakkisath’s death?” He looked pointedly at Bryna again.
The mage had adjusted with her usual quickness. “Haleh”—she paused, looking for recognition of the name, then continued at Vaelan’s nod—“says that she can use the blood to repair an amulet that would grant us access to Onyxia’s lair.”
Vaelan’s eyes widened at that, and a smile formed beneath his thick mustache. “Then I will give you whatever aid I can. The gemstones are held by the leadership of the clans residing below. At times, they carry the gemstones on them, other times, they are hidden in their chambers.” His shoulders fell. “I have been unable to acquire any of them.”
Remembering their foray into the heart of the Dark Iron Dwarf city below, Elthas looked at Kamery. She read his look and nodded.</Text>

            <Title>Badlands Assassination</Title>
            <Synopsis>Kamery is sent to the Badlands to counter the growing Dark Iron threat. She temporarily throws the Dark Irons into disarray by assassinating their leader in the area.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Several days later, far to the northeast of Stormwind, Kamery crept silently through the corridors of Angor Fortress. The Dwarven stronghold, now occupied by Dark Iron Dwarves, exhibited the detailed, but heavy, stonework that typified Dwarven architecture. While she objectively knew that the fortress had stood for hundreds of years already, and would likely stand strong for hundreds more, Kamery still couldn’t shake the feeling of being buried alive.
She missed Stormwind’s soaring white stone buildings; even the air in here felt heavier. She hadn’t been in her home city long on either of her last two visits, she reflected ruefully. Both times, Shaw had almost immediately sent her back out into the field.
The first had been a cryptic, but welcome, directive to continue traveling with Carolyn, Elthas, and Bryna. Bryna herself had relayed that instruction, given while Kamery had been learning some new moves from the trainers below.
Her second, most recent, visit to Stormwind had resulted in her mission here, in the Badlands—well outside Stormwind’s own lands, in the areas once trampled by the Horde in their initial invasion and yet to be reclaimed. Shaw’s quick briefing ran through her head. The Dark Iron Dwarves had summoned an Elemental Lord, Ragnaros, beneath Blackrock Mountain. She was to disrupt the Dark Iron expansion into the Badlands by destroying its overseer, Ragnaros’s minion, Infernus.
  Fire elementals were well outside her knowledge, despite Shaw’s quick briefing, but there had been something in Shaw’s eyes that steadied her step now. He had trusted in her to accomplish this mission, and she would not let him down.
Slipping easily past a distracted guard, Kamery turned into a corridor leading deeper into the oppressive fortress. Flickering torches lit the way, adding smoke and heat to the atmosphere. Shaw had been right to be concerned about the growing Dark Iron presence here in the Badlands, so far from their usual home in Blackrock Mountain, much further west.
As she crested a ramp leading downwards, a hint of ozone in the air and a faint crackling sound brought her firmly back to the present moment. On the landing below her, a Dark Iron shaman was pacing, surrounded by defensive globes of lightning.
Kamery paused at the top of the ramp to assess her options. She could try to slip past him unseen, but she could feel the tingle of the lightning from up here and suspected that she would not be able to maintain her hold on the shadows that hid her if she ventured much closer. The ramp turned back below the landing though, and she could easily drop off of the edge where she was now and land on the lower leg.
Given the symmetry of the fortress and its defenses so far, she suspected that there was a matching ramp on the other side of her target’s underground chamber. Of course, it would also have a matching shaman. My whole plan is to throw them into disarray by destroying their elemental master. Those shamans will be the first to react, the first to sound the alarm. I’ll be able to slip out in the chaos.
Her mind made up, Kamery stepped lightly up onto the low wall edging the rail, little more than ankle height, even to Dwarves, and lowered herself quietly to the ramp below. She was almost at her quarry now, and she took a moment to refresh the poisons on her daggers and double check the placement of the potions in their loops on the inside of her belt—mostly healing, a couple of others to give her a quick boost of agility or speed, and one to offer protection from flames.
Preparations complete, Kamery glided forwards, along a short hallway and into the fortress’s main chamber. Once the seat of whatever Dwarven Thane that had once watched over this land, it was now occupied by a massive fire elemental. A massive torso of flame, with a low face and powerful arms, drifted on a base of dark smoke as he moved.
Feeling the heat shimmering off the lesser elemental, Kamery considered preemptively using her fire protection potion. However, the potion’s effects were short-lived, and with only one at her disposal, she hesitated. The recipe had been difficult, and she didn’t want to waste it.
Infernus was drifting aimlessly around the chamber, and Kamery chose her moment carefully. As the elemental passed, she struck, her daggers seeming to slide effortlessly through the flame of his body. Shaw had assured her that the enchanted blades would be effective though, as would her poisons.
The elemental noticed, certainly, turning to swipe at her with one powerful fist, with a sound somewhere between a roar of rage and a crackling fire. Enchanted bracers on his wrists lent weight to his movement and the force of the blow set Kamery on her heels momentarily.
Dodging backwards, she flipped her right dagger and threw it in one swift motion. Her now-free hand quickly snatched a bright yellow potion from her belt and she quaffed it. Her muscles instantly felt looser, more responsive, and she lunged back in at the fire elemental.
Ducking under his next furious, but poorly aimed swing, she took hold of her dagger, which had somehow lodged in the flame of his left shoulder. With a vicious twist, she pulled the dagger out again, noting with satisfaction that the elemental’s second roar sounded more pained than angered. The sounds would bring his guards anytime now though, Kamery knew, so she had to finish this quickly and vanish into the shadows again.
Her daggers flashed again, one high and one low, and Infernus faltered, sinking lower on his pillar of smoke. He wasn’t done though, and she felt the impact and heat as his heavy arm swung once more, striking her leg. It was a clumsy blow, but it still staggered her.
His fiery eyes flared with satisfaction, but it quickly faded as her daggers once more found their marks. Her poisons were coursing through his body now also, and his flame was flickering and darkening.
The end was sudden, taking her by surprise, as the flaming body suddenly erupted in a shower of sparks, then vanished, leaving only the bracers to clatter to the stone floor. Footsteps outside the door alerted Kamery to her continued danger, and she quickly snatched up the bracers, shoving the still-warm bands into her pouch, and melted back into the shadows behind the Thane’s seat.
Kamery waited, silent, while the Dark Irons discovered the disappearance of their master, and scattered, searching. Her left thigh ached and her palms were slightly sore from the heated metal. As the Dark Irons left, Kamery slowly, cautiously, pulled a red healing potion from her belt and drank it, noting with satisfaction that she hadn’t needed to use the fire protection potion after all. Healing warmth spread through her body, helping, but not quite healing all of the damage. She missed Carolyn.
As the sounds of the Dark Irons dispersed into the distance, Kamery knew that she had to leave while they were still in disarray. Moving slowly, she limped to the ramp leading upwards, pleased to see that her earlier assumption had been correct—the shamans were no longer at their posts. Favoring her injured leg, the rogue slowly made her way out of the fortress.
At least, she reflected, she wouldn’t have to limp the entire way back to Stormwind. Once she was clear of the scurrying Dark Iron Dwarves, she raised a shiny new silver whistle to her lips and blew. Moments later, her newest companion responded, running up to her with a whinny and a shake of his dark grey mane. Running her hand down his smooth coat, Kamery mounted the black horse and turned his head towards the Dwarven lands to the north.
Reveling in the speed, she wondered if her sister had finally been successful in her determined pursuit of a Darnassus moonsaber.</Text>

            <Text>Kamery glanced up across the map table as the King approached. Standing beside her, Maxwell had shown her what they knew of the Dark Iron and Blackrock activity in the area. Most of it seemed centered around the Mountain itself, where both clans had settled after the Wars, although rarely at peace with each other.
“It seems that Windsor has been taken to the depths of the mountain,” King Varian stated. Raynn and Carolyn moved closer, to stand at the side of the table next to Kamery. With one hand, she showed them the area that the King referred to.
Maxwell shook his head sadly. “He’s lost then. That’s the stronghold of the Dark Iron Dwarves.”
“I need a group of your finest men,” King Varian instructed the Marshal, but Maxwell continued to shake his head.
“All I have is what you see.” The Marshal gestured around the small, nearly-deserted encampment. “Perhaps these adventurers?” He nodded towards Kamery, Raynn, and Carolyn.
The King frowned. “That’s not enough.”
Kamery noticed Raynn stiffen, and braced herself, but the confrontation she expected didn’t come to pass. Instead, the tension was broken by an unexpected diversion. A familiar red hat drifted in through the open gate of the palisade. Bryna’s hat stood out even more in this dull and blackened landscape, and they all watched as she approached, waiting to hear the results of her journey.
The mage was frowning as she rode her magical carpet through the abandoned village, with Elthas loping at her side. Knowing Bryna’s usual ability to keep her expression bland, Kamery wondered just how badly things had gone in Lakeshire.</Text>

            <Notes>Has Marshal Maxwell heard about King Varian’s return? How does he handle the ‘King’ showing up? - He’s pretty new, flustered and overwhelmed. He doesn’t really question it.
- Anduin has told Magni that feels something is “amiss” about his father, but can’t say what (Varian heard second-hand from Magni)
- Anduin has requested further investigation into his father’s abduction; Varian agreed, but Prestor intercepted and had him assign one of her own agents rather than SI:7 (unknown to anyone here)

            <Title>WTB Portal to Darnassus</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Druids at the Park tell Elthas he's ready to learn a new form; go back to Darnassus
- Elthas tracks down Bryna
- They find the others
- Goodbyes all around
- Bryna makes him a portal (for free)</Synopsis>
            <Text>Excitement surged through him as Elthas ran a circle around the Stormwind Park. The druids at the Park had been pleasant. They had enjoyed hearing his news of Kalimdor. In turn, they had shared their own observations of the Human lands. Although they hadn’t been able to teach him anything themselves, they had suggested that he was ready to learn a new form from his trainers back in Darnassus. A new form! The thought made him add leaps of joy to his stride. He heard a laugh from the center of the Park. He knew that the older Kaldorei were amused by his enthusiasm, but he didn’t care. A new form!
But first, he had to get back to Darnassus. That thought slowed him to a contemplative walk. He knew that there were boats to Auberdine, but they traveled from Menethil Harbor, and he only had a vague idea of where that was. Carolyn had told him of her trip, but it had been a blur of unfamiliar place names. Deeprun Tram, Ironforge, Loch Modan, Wetlands…he had no idea where any of those places were.
He would have to find a mage then. Perhaps he could find Bryna again. He had seen which direction the Humans had gone in. Perhaps their scent hadn’t faded yet. Mind made up, Elthas quickly thanked the druids of the Park, and trotted back to the bridge to the Mage Quarter.
The familiar scents were faint, but still there. Opening his senses, he followed the trail into the narrow passage. Tall buildings rose on either side of him, seemingly built at random, with the pathway between them winding and turning unexpectedly. The grass was soft under-paw, at least, he reflected, choosing to dwell on the positives.
A sudden miasma of unpleasant aromas wafted over him, making his whiskers twitch and droop. Shaking his head to clear it, he instinctively turned away from the source, a lively looking inn bearing a sign proclaiming it to be ‘The Slaughtered Lamb.’ They did more than slaughter lambs there, Elthas thought, disapprovingly. There had been some distinctly Fel elements in that scent.
As the Lamb disappeared around a bend, he returned to his mission. Luckily, the Humans had gone this way also, and he was able to pick up their trail again. His nose close to the ground, he entered into a wide open area, almost as big as the Park had been, but this one had a massive tower in the middle of it, rather than a fountain.
Skirting a group Human mages who were deep in a discussion of ley lines, he followed the trail as it turned in to a shop. Shifting out of feline form, he pushed open the sturdy wooden door and, ducking his head, entered the warm atmosphere of the shop.
Carolyn wasn’t there, he noticed immediately, but Bryna was. The mage was engaged in an animated conversation with the shop keepers—about silk, not ley lines. Elthas felt that that wasn’t much better, but in any case, the conversation ended when they noticed him enter.
Taking in his rugged leather leggings and vest, the shopkeeper frowned. “I’m sorry,” the man offered apologetically, “the leather worker is—”
“Dad,” Bryna interrupted, “this is Elthas!”
Looking between the three, Elthas could see the family resemblances. He thought of his own parents. His father had been asleep in the Emerald Dream since just before his birth; he had never met the druid, but held hope that someday he would join him. Although, perhaps not anytime soon. The Emerald Dream didn’t sound very interesting. 
His mother was a Sentinel, and had been sent to Astranaar a decade ago. He had already begun his druidic training by then, and hadn’t seen her again until a few months ago. He and Carolyn had worked with her briefly during their adventures in Ashenvale, but she had been distant and businesslike. Nothing like the warmth he sensed between Human families.
Bryna’s parents smiled, welcoming him. They drew him into the family huddle, asking about his and Bryna’s adventures together. He was happy to honestly tell them how calmly she handled herself in battle.
“What brings you here?” Bryna finally asked. “Carolyn’s gone to the Cathedral.”
He nodded, and gave her a smile, telling her, “I’m actually here for you. I need to go back to Darnassus.” He couldn’t keep the excitement out of his voice.
Bryna’s hat tipped back as she looked up at him. “Back to Darnassus? Well, alright.” She began to gather arcane energy in her hands.
“Wait,” Elthas interrupted, thinking of Carolyn, his companion over the past year. He couldn’t just leave like this. “I want to say goodbye to the others.”
Bryna’s mother gave her daughter a look that said that this wasn’t the first time the mage had overlooked goodbyes.
“Go.” Her father shooed the pair to the door. “The shop will be here when you get back.”
“Whenever that is,” his wife added with a wry smile.
With a grin at her parents, Bryna followed Elthas out of the door. Dropping back into feline form, he followed the mage through the winding pathways of the Mage Quarter back to the canals. The route was shorter than the way he had come in, and they came out in a different spot, out of view of the Park, and thankfully not passing the pungent Slaughtered Lamb again.
Bryna led them easily along the canals, crossing two of the ubiquitous bridges, and into the Cathedral Square. As they walked, she asked him why he wanted to return to Darnassus. Wanting to keep the new form a surprise, he responded only, “Training.”
At the Cathedral Square, Elthas picked up another familiar scent—Kamery had been here recently. The rogue was nowhere in sight now though, and neither was her sister. Disappointment made his tail droop as he looked up at the imposing Cathedral. The Light and Nature often worked in unison, and he enjoyed pairing his healing with Carolyn’s, but there was something about this rigid stone building that disquieted him.
Bryna seemed to pick up on his feelings, saying, “I’ll see if she’s still here.” She jogged up the short flight of stairs and into the building. Prowling about the Square, Elthas tried to sort out Kamery and Carolyn’s scents.
Bryna returned quickly, shaking her head. “She left a little while ago,” the mage told Elthas. “I don’t know where she went.”
Shifting quickly out of form, Elthas reassured the mage, “I may have a lead. I think she and Kamery went this way.” He pointed to the narrow archway their scents had disappeared into.
“Alright.” The mage smiled quickly. “If we don’t find them, you can at least say goodbye to Raynn. I’ll bet she’s back at the forge in the Dwarven District.”
Elthas dropped back into feline form and led the way out to the canals. The many districts of the city were still confusing, but he trusted Bryna’s sense of direction. They followed the scent trail across a bridge, and around the edge of what Bryna identified as the Dwarven District. He could hear the banging and clanking of blacksmithing and something more mechanical emerging from amidst the low brown-roofed buildings. 
As they passed an arched entrance into the District, smoke assailed his nose, and he lost the scent briefly. It didn’t matter though, Carolyn and Kamery had just emerged from the Keep ahead, and Bryna was waving to get their attention.</Text>

            <Title>25-05-L28-The Missing Diplomat</Title>
            <Text>In the bustling streets of Stormwind, Kamery makes her way to the SI:7 headquarters to report the successful completion of their Deadmines operation to Mathias Shaw. Meanwhile, Carolyn, feeling the need for a moment of reflection, decides to visit the Cathedral of Light.

As Carolyn steps into the grand Cathedral, its towering spires reaching toward the heavens, she finds solace in the quiet serenity within. While admiring the stained glass windows depicting the Light's teachings, she is approached by Thomas, a young altar boy.

&quot;Excuse me, ma'am,&quot; Thomas says politely. &quot;Bishop DeLavey has been seeking an adventurer with discretion. Might you be the one he's looking for?&quot;

Intrigued, Carolyn agrees to meet with Bishop DeLavey. They convene in a side chamber of Stormwind Keep, away from the prying eyes of the court. The bishop explains the delicate situation: a diplomat has gone missing on his way to meet Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore, and they need someone trustworthy to deliver a letter.

Bishop DeLavey hands Carolyn the sealed letter and implores her to find the missing diplomat and deliver the message. The letter contains important information that could shed light on the diplomat's disappearance.

Stepping out of Stormwind Keep, Carolyn makes her way to a fisherman named Jorgen, just outside the city walls. Jorgen receives the letter, scans its contents, and hands Carolyn a second letter addressed to Elling Trias, a cheese vendor in the Trade District.

With Kamery now joining her, Carolyn delivers the letter to Elling Trias, who, after reading the contents, sends them to Watcher Backus near Darkshire for further instructions. Watcher Backus is concerned about Defias activity in western Duskwood and asks the two adventurers to investigate.

Following the clues, Carolyn and Kamery make their way to Addle's Stead in Duskwood, where they uncover crucial information about the Defias plans. Satisfied with their findings, they return to Elling Trias with the intelligence.

Trias, pleased with their efforts, entrusts them with one more task – to meet his contact in Menethil Harbour, where the next chapter of their adventure awaits.

Elthas, having dedicated himself to furthering his druidic studies in the serene surroundings of Darnassus, finds fulfillment in mastering new forms. The cheetah form, allowing for swift travel on land, brings a joyful sense of speed, and the sea lion form, facilitating underwater exploration, deepens his connection with nature.

With his training complete, Elthas decides it's time to reunite with his friends in the Eastern Kingdoms. Boarding the boat from Auberdine to Menethil Harbour, he enjoys the gentle rocking of the vessel as it makes its way across the ocean. The rhythmic sound of the waves against the boat's hull lulls him into a state of contemplation.

As the boat docks at Menethil Harbour, Elthas steps onto the solid ground of the Eastern Kingdoms. To his pleasant surprise, he doesn't have to search far to find his companions. There, standing on the pier, are Carolyn and Kamery – the reunion marked by smiles and the warmth of shared camaraderie. The trio, now reunited, prepares for the adventures that lie ahead.

---

Bryna, having honed her arcane skills under the guidance of her mage trainers in Stormwind, reaches a milestone in her magical education. She learns the intricate spell to teleport to Theramore, a city known for its association with powerful mages and strategic importance.

Eager to expand her knowledge, Bryna ventures to Theramore, seeking the mentorship of none other than Jaina Proudmoore. As one of the most formidable mages on Azeroth, Jaina's tutelage promises invaluable insights into the arcane arts.

During her time in Theramore, Bryna delves into advanced magical studies under Jaina's watchful eye. The city's serene surroundings provide a conducive environment for focused learning. The mentorship becomes the foundation for future visits, as Bryna's magical prowess continues to grow under Jaina's guidance.

---

The trio, consisting of Kamery, Carolyn, and Elthas, unravels the mystery surrounding the missing diplomat, only to discover that the individual in question is none other than Varian Wrynn, the absent king of Stormwind. The trail of clues points them in the direction of Theramore, prompting Mikhail, their reliable bartender contact in Menethil Harbour, to assure them that he will relay information to Elling Trias. Urged by the urgency of the situation, the group wastes no time and boards the next available ship bound for Theramore.

---

Kamery, Carolyn, and Elthas, driven by their determination to uncover the truth behind the missing diplomat, King Varian Wrynn, follow the trail of clues leading to Theramore. The pieces of the puzzle seem to converge on this coastal city, prompting them to embark on the next available ship from Menethil Harbour.

As the ship cuts through the open waters, the trio contemplates the gravity of their mission. The missing king's whereabouts and the political implications weigh heavily on their minds. Their journey to Theramore becomes a crucial step in unraveling the mystery and, perhaps, bringing the lost monarch back to Stormwind.

Upon reaching Theramore, the adventurers brace themselves for the challenges that lie ahead. The port city holds its own secrets and intrigues, and they are determined to navigate through them to uncover the truth behind King Varian Wrynn's disappearance. The investigation intensifies as they delve deeper into the political landscape of Azeroth, each step bringing them closer to the heart of the matter.

---

In Theramore, the trio continues their investigation, following leads that lead them to the watch towers outside the city. At Sentry Point, they encounter Archmage Tervosh, a companion of Jaina Proudmoore, who has been sent to assist them. Tervosh shares crucial information, indicating that their target is further west, and he pledges to join them there with reinforcements.

Pressing onward, the adventurers confront the suspect, Private Hendel. With the combined efforts of Kamery, Carolyn, Elthas, and the reinforcements provided by Tervosh and Bryna, Hendel is subdued. The mission, at least for now, is a success.

In the aftermath of the confrontation, the group takes a moment to rest at the inn in Theramore. The weight of the investigation and the events surrounding King Varian Wrynn's disappearance lingers in the air, but their collaboration with Jaina's allies has proven fruitful. As they gather their strength, they know that more challenges and revelations lie ahead in their quest for the truth.

---

In the cozy confines of the inn in Theramore, Kamery, Carolyn, Elthas, and Bryna gathered around a sturdy wooden table. The air was filled with a mix of tension and relief, the aftermath of a successful confrontation with Private Hendel still lingering.

Carolyn, her priestess robes marked by the day's exertion, leaned forward, her eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight. &quot;Well, that was unexpected. A missing diplomat turning out to be King Varian Wrynn himself. Do you think Jaina knew about this?&quot;

Kamery, taking a sip from her mug of ale, shook her head. &quot;Hard to say. Our contacts in Menethil Harbour seemed as surprised as we were. And Jaina... she's got her secrets.&quot;

Elthas, in his night elf form, nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Regardless, we've played our part. Now we wait for Tervosh and the reinforcements. Hopefully, they can shed more light on this situation.&quot;

Bryna, her red hat pulled low, listened intently. &quot;What's our next move, then? Do we stick around Theramore or head back to Stormwind?&quot;

Kamery glanced at Carolyn, then to Elthas and Bryna. &quot;I say we wait for Tervosh, share what we've uncovered, and see where that leads us. We've got a missing king, and that's no small matter.&quot;

As they discussed their next steps, the inn's common room buzzed with activity. Patrons laughed and chatted, and the innkeeper bustled about attending to their needs. In the midst of uncertainty, the camaraderie among the four adventurers served as an anchor, a reminder that they were stronger together.

---

Elthas, now in his sea lion form, gracefully glided through the waters off the coast of Dustwallow. The ocean's depths, illuminated by scattered sunlight, concealed the wreckage of the ill-fated ship.

As he swam among the debris, Elthas marveled at the newfound freedom granted by his aquatic form. The sea's currents carried him effortlessly, and he deftly maneuvered around pieces of the ship's hull. Eventually, he reached the ocean floor, where the remnants of the vessel lay scattered.

Using his druidic senses, Elthas retrieved various pieces of debris, examining them for clues about the ship's origin and cargo. His keen eyes discerned the glint of enchanted metal amidst the wreckage.

Picking up a pair of manacles, Elthas swam back to the waiting group. Breaking through the surface, he transformed back into his night elf form and handed the manacles to Renn.

Elthas emerged from the ocean, the enchanted manacles in hand, and made his way back to the shore where Renn McGill, the SI:7 agent, awaited anxiously.

&quot;Found these among the wreckage,&quot; Elthas said, handing the manacles to Renn. &quot;They're enchanted, and there's a good chance the ship's cargo was a human prisoner. Any leads on who it might be?&quot;

Renn examined the enchanted restraints, a furrow forming on his brow. &quot;Not yet, but this is crucial information. We should report back to Theramore immediately. The prisoner could be linked to either the missing king or the Defias threat.&quot;

Acknowledging the urgency of the situation, the group made their way back to Theramore, ready to share their findings and uncover the truth behind the mysterious shipwreck.

---

As the group emerged from Bryna's portal in Theramore, they found Jaina waiting for them, her expression a mix of anticipation and worry.

&quot;What did Bolvar say?&quot; Jaina inquired, her eyes searching theirs for any sign of hope.

Elthas spoke up, &quot;He expressed concern but Lady Prestor dismissed our findings as baseless speculation.&quot;

Jaina's eyes narrowed with frustration at Prestor's dismissal, but she quickly composed herself. &quot;I appreciate your efforts. We cannot afford to let this matter slide. I've been informed that the Black Dragonflight is involved, and that's a dangerous element we can't ignore.&quot;

She paused, considering their next move. &quot;I need you to investigate Alcaz Island more thoroughly. Whatever the Black Dragonflight's role is, it's crucial to our search for Varian. Take the gryphons again and report back with any information you find.&quot;

The group nodded in agreement, ready to delve deeper into the mystery surrounding Varian's disappearance.

---

Under the cover of night, Kamery and Elthas approached Alcaz Island on one of Theramore's gryphons. The cool sea breeze carried the scent of salt and adventure as the island loomed ahead, shrouded in darkness.

Elthas whispered to Kamery, &quot;We need to be careful. The naga have taken over this place, and they won't take kindly to intruders.&quot;

Kamery nodded, her keen rogue instincts at the forefront. As they descended, Elthas signaled the gryphon to circle around the perimeter of the island, keeping a watchful eye for any signs of activity.

The pair dismounted near the edge of the island, the gryphon disappearing into the night sky. Elthas shifted into his stealthy feline form, his night elven figure blending seamlessly with the shadows. Kamery, a master of subtlety, moved with a rogue's grace beside him.

They slinked through the dense foliage, avoiding naga patrols and keeping to the outskirts of the deserted town. The silence was broken only by the distant murmur of the sea and the occasional eerie cry of a naga.

As they reached the center of the town, Elthas pointed to a sturdy cage. &quot;This is where Varian was held. The scent trail leads towards the rune circle.&quot;

Kamery examined the disturbed ground and discarded shackles near the circle. &quot;It looks like there was a fierce fight, but against whom? The naga or the Defias?&quot;

Elthas crouched down to inspect the ground. &quot;Varian managed to break free, and then there was a clash between the Defias and the naga. But look here, the scent trails... it's as if Varian's presence split into two directions.&quot;

Kamery frowned. &quot;That's strange. Magic, perhaps?&quot;

Elthas nodded, &quot;It's a possibility. Let's follow both trails and see where they lead.&quot;

As they moved toward the rune circle, the magical essence in the air became palpable, and the scent trails became more confusing. The duo continued their stealthy investigation, determined to uncover the mysteries that Alcaz Island held.

---

Jaina listened intently as Kamery and Elthas reported their findings. When they explained the confusing scent trails and the magical essence lingering in the air, Jaina sighed. &quot;It seems we've hit a dead end for now. I can't discern the full extent of the magic involved, and without more concrete leads, we can't risk further investigation.&quot;

She glanced at Tervosh, who nodded solemnly. &quot;Indeed, Lady Proudmoore. I will continue to monitor for any magical traces that may lead us to Varian, but we must proceed with caution.&quot;

Jaina turned back to Kamery and Elthas. &quot;I appreciate your efforts. Unfortunately, there's nothing more we can do at the moment. The safety of Theramore comes first.&quot;

The duo nodded, understanding the difficult decision. &quot;If anything changes, we'll be ready to assist,&quot; Kamery assured.

Jaina sighed, &quot;Thank you. I'll keep you informed if we discover anything substantial.&quot;

As Kamery and Elthas left Jaina's chambers, they found the rest of their group waiting anxiously in the inn. Carolyn and Bryna looked up expectantly.

Kamery shook her head. &quot;No luck. Jaina and Tervosh will continue to investigate magically, but for now, there's little we can do.&quot;

Elthas added, &quot;We need to be patient. If Varian's out there, they'll find him. In the meantime, perhaps we should return to Menethil. We saw many people in need of help when we passed through earlier.&quot;

The group agreed, their resolve unbroken despite the challenges. They prepared to set sail back to Menethil Harbour, ready to face whatever challenges awaited them in the Eastern Kingdoms.</Text>

            <Title>Golem Lord Argelmach</Title>
            <Synopsis>- They get Windsor’s notes from Argelmach.
- In Argelmach’s chamber, the Manufactory, Raynn finds some diagrams for making armor out of dark iron that would resist fire.
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Finally, the manufacturing room below was clear, save for Argelmach and his golems, and Raynn indicated that they should proceed. While another hallway led out of the room to the right, it was the small room directly across from them that held their current target.
The workers here had been crafting golems from the dark iron that was prevalent in this mountain. Raynn had found a few loose pieces of the ore, but she wasn’t sure if she would be able to do anything with it. It didn’t look like anything she had worked before, but it had been interesting enough to tuck away in her bags.
As they crossed the room now, she studied their next foes. The Dark Iron Dwarf was almost as tall as she was, and his two golem guardians were twice as tall. They looked more dangerous than the unfinished golems that they had fought already. She was certain she could hold their attention though, if the others gave her a moment, but she worried that their magical attacks would be too much for Carolyn to keep up with.
“Let me draw one away,” Broll growled from her side. He was in his bear form already; he hadn’t left it since they had entered the garrison. Raynn glanced at Carolyn for confirmation, and the priestess nodded.
“Alright, take the left golem.” She barely had time for the direction before Argelmach noticed them. Raynn met his angry charge head on, slamming her shield into the Dark Iron Dwarf’s chest. Her sword swung to the side, twisting into the golem’s hip joint. She felt something give way, as she drew the sword free to parry the golem’s swing.
To her left, she heard Broll’s growl as he kept the other golem occupied. Sidestepping to survey the battlefield, she noted with satisfaction that Bryna, Elthas, and Kamery were all focused on the golem that was attacking her.
Varian also seemed to be dealing most of his damage to that one, although his wild blows struck all three of their foes. Once again, his fighting style reminded her of Grom Hellscream. She wondered what the Human king would think of the comparison.
He was effective though, and the golem stumbled and froze as their combined attacks damaged its mechanisms. The second golem was next, although Argelmach grew more and more agitated as his creations were demolished.
Blocking a heavy blow with her shield, Raynn felt her arm buckle under the assault. She stumbled backwards, trying to regroup. His next blow, she caught on her raised sword. A welcome surge of healing warmth flooded through her, and she cast Carolyn a grateful glance.
Despite the damage he was taking from her allies, Argelmach was relentless. Another heavy blow swung at her, and Raynn set herself, bracing her shield with both arms. Again, the blow sent pain shuddering through her, but this time her feet remained solidly planted.
Eventually, the Golem Lord flagged, his wounds too much for him. Exhausted, Raynn lowered her shield, dragging in deep breaths. Another surge of holy power bathed her in healing. Elthas shifted out of feline form behind the fallen forms of their opponents, and she felt the slow rejuvenation of his nature-driven healing.
Smiling her appreciation, she stood back to allow Kamery to search for Windsor’s notes. A heavy hand on Raynn’s shoulder startled her, and she looked up to see Varian looking at her.
“Well fought,” the King said, his voice also reflecting the exertion of the recent battle. “You use that shield well.”
Remembering Carolyn’s earlier words to him, Raynn smiled. “Perhaps you should try one too.”
Varian laughed, a clear, deep sound, and moved away to see if Kamery had found anything.
A rest seemed like a good idea, so Raynn joined Carolyn and Bryna on the benches at the side of the room. As she sat, papers on the bench beside her caught her eye. Picking them up, she realized that they were diagrams and notes on making armor—from dark iron.
The Dwarven runes down the side of the paper noted that such armor would be highly resistant to flame. Thinking of the flame-guard elementals that pervaded this place, Raynn tucked the plans into her bag with the chunks of dark iron ore. She needed to learn how to craft with the material.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Bryna assesses the others while they plan the trip to Moonbrook and the Defias headquarters.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A haze of smoky air filled the inn, originating from both the crackling fireplace and the pipes that several of the patrons lazily puffed on. At the bar in one corner, the innkeeper pulled a draft of beer for a waiting customer. Although the common room didn’t seem empty, it was far from full. From a door beside the bar, the enticing aroma of stew drifted out from the inn’s kitchen. Several furniture groupings were arranged about the room; in one corner, Bryna and her newfound companions had found a quiet table.
Not for the first time, Bryna wondered what she had gotten herself into. With studied nonchalance, she looked over the assembled group from beneath the brim of her hat. Now complete, with Raynn joining them, they were deep in planning, but she only half-listened. A mage’s role in group combat was fairly straightforward, and Bryna found it much more interesting to know her companions. Mismatched armor and torn robes were not good harbingers for the upcoming venture, but below the ill-fitting and battered gear, there were signs of something else. Despite their varied backgrounds, their conversation flowed easily, and her heart felt lighter as she casually perused the group.
Carolyn and Kamery shared a face, but seemingly nothing else. The blonde-haired priestess looked around herself with wide, open eyes, and a peaceful smile. She seemed relaxed, and ready to follow her sister’s lead. The rogue, on the other hand, was all narrowed eyes and focus. Her attention was currently on the sketch on the table, which depicted her previous foray into the Deadmines. 
Kamery calmly and quietly described her infiltration of the upper levels of the underground base, pointing to several key spots and noting, “It looked like overturned mine carts used as barricades.” Bryna allowed herself a faint smile at the rogue’s prowess.
Raynn, looking solid and dependable in a mix of plate and mail armor, was also studying the map. When Bryna, Carolyn, and Elthas had arrived, after the introductions, Kamery had spoken well of the soon-to-arrive warrior and her combat ability. It would be a refreshing change, Bryna thought, to have someone else take the attention of her enemies, so she might focus her magic on offense, not having to slow or trap them.
The warrior was listening intently, and she bent over the map to point out a strategic choke point. “Could we draw them here? Rather than face them out in the open.” Raynn’s suggestion seemed solid, but there was an undercurrent of uncertainty in her attitude. Bryna wondered it was due to a lack of confidence, but decided it was more likely simply inexperience.
Although Raynn’s attention was on the planning, every now and then, her eyes would dart suspiciously over at Kamery, leaving Bryna intrigued. She didn’t think the rogue had noticed, but it left her wondering at the unspoken history between the two.
Elthas sat next to the enigmatic warrior, having chosen to forgo his feline form for reasons yet unknown to Bryna. His dark blue hair hung over the druidic runes tattooed on his shoulders as he hunched forward in the cramped chair, carefully studying the details of the map.
The mage felt a pang of empathy, remembering how out of place she had felt during her visit to Tinkertown, home to the Gnomes. The race, known for their engineering brilliance and, more pertinent to her, their adept use of magic, were also notably among the smallest in stature. Bryna’s lips twitched in amusement at the mental image of the towering Kaldorei amidst the diminutive Gnomes. Remembering the druid’s energetic bounds as an agile panther, she suspected that he would be much happier when he returned to feline form.
Finishing her survey of the others, Bryna allowed herself a quick moment of self-evaluation. A versatile mage, she could wreathe her foes in fire, chill their blood with ice, or devastate them with pure arcane energy. She was still young though, still learning to fully tap into the potential Jennea had seen in her four years ago.
Her abilities were enhanced by the enchantments of power that she had woven into her clothing and staff. Their illusion enchantments often helped lull her enemies into underestimating her. Surprise, she had learned, was a mage’s best tool.
Where she failed, she knew, was in attentiveness, especially in her studies. She was often restless, and flitted from subject to subject, without truly mastering any. Even now, she admitted, she was relying on the others to properly prepare for their venture.
As she watched Kamery trace a line on the map and Raynn nod attentively, Bryna decided that she was in good hands. Hopefully she would be able to put her escape spells to the back of her mind on this escapade.</Text>

            <Text>Under the shadow of the towering trees in Marshal's Refuge, Kamery received the missive from Mathias Shaw, the ink on the parchment spelling out a new chapter in their journey. The group gathered around, and she read the letter aloud, the weight of its contents settling in.

&quot;Agents, he wants us to deal with the Dark Irons in the Searing Gorge,&quot; Kamery summarized, her eyes scanning the expressions of her friends.

Carolyn, her priestess robe reflecting the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, spoke first. &quot;Well, we knew we couldn't stay here forever. The Dark Irons need to be dealt with, and we're the ones for the job.&quot;

Elthas, in his feline form, nodded in agreement. &quot;Aye, the call to action has come. We'll need to be careful in the Gorge, though. Those Dark Irons are a formidable lot.&quot;

Raynn adjusted the straps on her armor, a determined glint in her eyes. &quot;No time to waste, then. Bryna, can you get us to Ironforge quickly?&quot;

Bryna, standing a little apart from the group, raised her hands, summoning a portal to the heart of the Dwarven capital. The familiar hum of magical energy enveloped them, and they stepped through the portal, emerging in Ironforge.

As they gathered their bearings in the bustling city, Elthas spoke, &quot;Remember, we avoid Stormwind. Shaw's orders.&quot;

They made their way towards the entrance of Ironforge, the city's mighty gates standing open to welcome them. The journey to the Searing Gorge awaited, and with a resolute nod, they set forth, leaving the warmth and greenery of Un'goro Crater behind.

Little did they know that the challenges ahead would test their mettle in ways they hadn't faced before, forging bonds of camaraderie even stronger than those forged in the jungles of Un'goro. The call of duty echoed in the stone halls of Ironforge as they embarked on the next chapter of their adventures.

---

In the dimly lit halls of Stormwind Keep, Bryna, her once vibrant red hat now replaced with a modest ponytail, approached Bolvar Fordragon. The atmosphere was tense, the weight of their mission heavy on their shoulders.

The Magistrate of Lakeshire had dispatched them to seek aid, and now, Bolvar's gaze met Bryna's as she relayed their findings. Lady Prestor, the purported dragon expert, dismissed their concerns. Bryna, although disheartened by the lack of immediate assistance, maintained her composure.

As she exited the keep, contemplating the next steps, a shadow detached itself from the corners of the hallway. Mathias Shaw, the master tactician, emerged from the darkness, his eyes meeting Bryna's.

&quot;Bryna,&quot; he spoke in hushed tones, &quot;I've been keeping an eye on this situation. There's more at play here than meets the eye. You need to go back to your friends and continue investigating. I can't put my finger on it, but something's not right.&quot;

Bryna nodded, absorbing Shaw's words. &quot;Understood. We'll get to the bottom of this.&quot;

With that, she stepped back into the daylight of Stormwind, the city's grandeur contrasting with the shadows lurking beneath its surface. The journey was far from over, and the mystery of the Blackrock Orcs and their connection to the dragons would demand their attention. Bryna, her determination unwavering, made her way back to Lakeshire ready to rejoin her companions and press on with the investigation.

---

In the fiery depths of Blackrock Depths, the group moved stealthily through the oppressive darkness. Kamery, with her dual daggers at the ready, expertly picked the locks on cell doors as they navigated the winding corridors, facing the formidable Dark Iron guards.

Their initial encounter with Windsor was one of subdued hopelessness. The marshal believed his notes were lost, leaving him despondent in his cell. Undeterred, the group pressed forward, determined to uncover the vital information that had eluded the captive marshal.

As they explored the labyrinthine dungeon, facing the relentless Dark Iron guards and cunning traps, Kamery skillfully picked locks and disarmed obstacles with precision. Each encounter was a strategic dance of stealth and combat, with Elthas prowling in the shadows, Carolyn providing healing support, and Raynn leading the charge with her shield.

Their efforts led them to the Dark Iron generals who held the clues to the missing information. In a coordinated assault, they subdued the generals and retrieved the critical details regarding the Black Dragonflight's influence. With the information secured, they returned to Windsor, who remained in his cell, unaware of their success.

In a dramatic turn, the group presented Windsor with the valuable notes, rekindling a spark of hope in the marshal's eyes. The information unveiled the intricate connections between the Black Dragonflight and various factions, extending beyond the Dark Iron Dwarves and Blackrock Orcs.

With their mission accomplished, they escorted Windsor out of the depths of Blackrock Depths, emerging into the relative safety of the Burning Steppes. The rescued marshal now held a key piece in the puzzle of the black dragon's influence, setting the stage for the broader investigation into the shadowy alliances that threatened the realm.</Text>

            <Text>Raynn stood on the walls of Lunarfall, the cool Draenor breeze tugging at strands of her auburn hair. The moon cast a soft glow over the garrison, and in the distance, the stars adorned the night sky like diamonds.
Varian approached, his presence commanding attention even in the quiet of the night. She could feel the weight of his gaze on her, a magnetic pull that she couldn't deny. The tension between them, born of differences and unexpected attraction, lingered in the air.
&quot;Commander,&quot; Varian's voice was deep, resonating through the stillness. &quot;It's a quiet night.&quot;
Raynn turned to face him, the moonlight revealing the lines of determination etched on her face. &quot;Quiet, but not still. Draenor is full of life, even in the shadows.&quot;
Varian nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. &quot;You're a capable leader, Raynn. Your people respect you.&quot;
A hint of a smile played on her lips. &quot;Respect is earned, King Wrynn. It's not given freely.&quot;
He stepped closer, the distance between them diminishing. &quot;True. Anduin speaks highly of you. Considers you a friend.&quot;
&quot;Anduin sees the potential for peace,&quot; Raynn replied, her gaze unwavering. &quot;Something I believe in.&quot;
Varian's eyes flickered, a mixture of emotions crossing his face. &quot;Peace is a delicate thing. It requires strength to uphold.&quot;
Raynn sensed the complexity in his words, a reflection of the burdens he carried. &quot;Strength comes in many forms, King Varian. Sometimes, it's the strength to understand and find common ground.&quot;
He studied her, a silent acknowledgment of their differing perspectives. In that moment, the attraction between them hung in the air, a force that neither could easily dismiss.
&quot;Raynn,&quot; Varian's voice softened, a rare vulnerability seeping through. &quot;You're not what I expected.&quot;
She met his gaze, her own eyes reflecting a myriad of emotions. &quot;And you're not what I expected, either.&quot;
The moon cast long shadows as Varian reached out, his fingers gently tracing the outline of her cheek. The touch sent a shiver through her, a response to the unspoken connection that lingered between them.
&quot;Perhaps there's more to both of us than meets the eye,&quot; Varian mused, his thumb brushing against her skin.
Raynn felt the pull, the magnetic force drawing them closer. In that quiet night on Draenor, beneath the watchful eyes of the stars, they stood at the precipice of something uncharted, guided by the enigmatic dance of attraction and understanding.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Raynn is confused by Grom's loss of control.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The fading light of the Barrens cast long shadows over the makeshift training ground. Grom Hellscream, once a paragon of orcish might, stood opposite Raynn, his usually vibrant eyes now smoldering with an unsettling intensity. Raynn felt the weight of his gaze, a silent storm brewing in the lines of his weathered face.

&quot;Ready yourself, Raynn,&quot; Grom's voice, gruff yet commanding, cut through the stillness of the evening. He hefted his massive axe, Gorehowl, the weapon that had cleaved through countless enemies, and assumed a battle stance.

Raynn, armed with a wooden training sword, mirrored his readiness. The tension in the air was palpable, a stark departure from their earlier sparring sessions. Grom's movements, once fluid and measured, now carried an undercurrent of unrestrained aggression.

The first clash of weapons echoed through the barren landscape. Raynn parried Grom's strikes with practiced skill, but each blow felt heavier, more ferocious than before. The mentor-student dance they had shared was evolving into a raw display of power.

&quot;Your strikes lack conviction, Raynn!&quot; Grom barked, his frustration evident in the force behind his swings. &quot;You must learn to unleash the fury within you!&quot;

Raynn, agile and determined, dodged and countered. Her instincts told her that something was amiss, that this sparring session held a different energy. She could see the turmoil in Grom's eyes, a conflict she couldn't fathom.

As the dance continued, Grom's attacks grew more relentless, less controlled. The once measured teacher now resembled a storm, chaotic and untamed. Raynn, recognizing the shift, maintained her guard, sensing that there was more to this struggle than met the eye.

In a brief respite between strikes, Grom paused, his gaze locked with Raynn's. &quot;You must face the darkness within you, Raynn. Embrace the power that courses through your veins.&quot;

Raynn, bewildered but resolute, nodded in acknowledgment. The words lingered in the air, a cryptic message from a mentor grappling with forces beyond her comprehension. The sparring continued, a dance of shadows on the canvas of the Barrens, each clash revealing a deeper layer of the tumultuous journey they shared.</Text>

            <Title>Galvan the Ancient</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Raynn arrives in Stranglethorn Vale
- Galvan the Ancient sets her to gathering materials first</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kings, missing or otherwise, were the furthest thing from Raynn’s mind, as she jogged along the winding road through Stranglethorn Vale. The packed dirt of the road was dry and cracked underfoot, and her boots left trace of her passing. The light, dusty dirt was a stark contrast to the lush colors of the jungle surrounding her.
Vines and twisting roots covered the rolling landscapes to either side of the road, dotted with bright purple and red flowers with broad, deep green leaves. Trees that she didn’t know the names to rose high overhead, their bare trunks covered with scaly bark, leading up to high leafy crowns that shaded the jungle floor. Raucous calls from brightly colored birds sounded from the treetops.
The air was still and heavy, filled with the monotonous buzz of insects, but every now and again, a light breath of breeze brought a hint of salty tang. As the road curved around another bend, she caught a glimpse of broad expanses of cerulean water in the distance. She was approaching Booty Bay at last.
The entrance to the town led through a tunnel in the steep hills surrounding the bay. A ship’s mast was mounted over the opening, and the tunnel was shored up with repurposed beams and ships’ rigging. It emerged onto a platform overlooking the town, a near-full circle, built on elevated boardwalks around the edge of a deep, steep-edged bay.
The small port town was a haven of ruffians and pirates, but rough-looking Goblin bruisers, working for the Steamwheedle Cartel, kept the peace in the town. Years ago, Raynn had encountered similar guards, in the Cartel town of Ratchet, in Kalimdor. Although not much more than half her height, the green-skinned Goblins were tough and muscular, and could easily subdue even a massive Tauren.
A long ramp to her right led down to the level of the main boardwalk, but to her left, a short bridge led to a narrow plateau in the hillside, at the end of which she spotted an open-air forge. Heading that way, she found a Human man working at the forge. He was wearing darkly gleaming armor of the same metal as the insignia she carried, and Raynn admired the intricate work.
“McGavan?” Raynn asked, and the man nodded distractedly.
When she presented the insignia, McGavan took notice, exclaiming, “Finally, one worthy of the Mithril Order!” He set aside the gauntlet that he was repairing, giving her his full attention. “Most of our recruits never make it to Booty Bay. The shine of the insignia is enough to trigger the loot lust in even the staunchest of blacksmiths. Fools they be, as the insignia is a drop in the bucket compared to the wealth of items you'll see!” His voice carried the lilting accent of Kul Tiras.
“Galvan will indeed teach you much, if you heed his words. Seek him out in the northern reaches of the Vale, between the Troll ruins of Zul Gurub and the Mosh’Ogg Ogre mound.” At Raynn’s nod of understanding, McGavan turned back to his repair work. He had a pile of such work nearby, she realized, and she left him to his work.
The sun was lowering behind the hills as she returned to the town entrance, so she asked one of the bruisers for the location of the inn. The gruff Goblin pointed across the bay to a building built around a ship’s bow, now raised well out of the water it had once sailed on. With a nod of gratitude, Raynn made her way around the creaking boardwalks. The lower floor, below the ship’s hull housed a bustling bar run by a cheerfully mercenary Goblin.
At her request for a room for the night, the innkeeper directed her upstairs, to a small room built against the outer hull of the ship. Through her small window, Raynn could see a waterfall cascading down the cliff outside. On the wall between the window and the door hung a painting of an unfamiliar desert town, incongruous in this lush green jungle.
Raynn felt a thrill of excitement as she considered the following day. She had traversed the northern part of the Vale already, and although she knew that the trip back would be long, the thought of learning to make armor like McGavan’s spurred her on. Although his directions had been vague, she had seen the Troll ruins and Ogres off to the west as she had passed, so she had some idea where to look.
If nothing else, she mused, she could always ask at Hemet Nesingwary’s encampment. A group of dedicated, and somewhat competitive, hunters, they had been friendly and welcoming when she had first passed through. She had spent her first night in the Vale at their small camp, where, around the crackling campfire, they had regaled her with tales, and warnings, of the wildlife to be found in the jungle.
The muted sound of falling water soothed her into sleep, and she woke the next morning refreshed and ready to make the long trip back north. The road passed quickly under her eager feet, and by mid-afternoon she found herself once more at the sagging vine-and-plank bridges that criss-crossed the deep river gorge that wound through the northern Vale.
In the distance to the east, Raynn could see the massive sandstone walls of the Troll stronghold of Zul Gurub, and she knew that the Ogres were just to the south, so she struck out through the jungle in what she hoped was the right direction. A feline roar sounded nearby, followed by the crack of a gunshot, suggesting the proximity of one of Nesingwary’s hunters.
A curl of smoke over a low ridge ahead gave her hope, and coming around the end of the rocky spur, she found a small camp nestled in a small hollow between steep hills. A campfire crackled and burned near the open end of the vale, and further back stood a forge, now cold, and a well-worn, but solid, anvil. A wooden slack tub stood nearby, filled with water.
A Dwarf sat by the fire, idling stirring a stew in a pot that hung off to one side of the heat. The stew was aromatic, although Raynn couldn’t quite identify the scents. The Dwarf’s head was balding, although he still had a long tail of grey-blond hair at the back of his neck. His beard and mustache were still full and thick, woven into heavy braids that fell to his waist.
He looked up as she approached. “What brings a stranger to Galvan’s camp?” he asked.
Raynn showed him the insignia, and his eyebrows rose, his dark eyes lighting with pleasure.
“Ah, many years it has been since one has been worthy of the Mithril Order's initiation. We will start now!” He stood abruptly, stew forgotten.
Raynn looked eagerly at the forge, but Galvan shook his head, beckoning her to follow as he left the camp. “Many blacksmiths believe that mining and smithing are separate, independent jobs.” Galvan scoffed. “Can the art of blacksmithing exist without its sister, mining? Ah ha—it is an impossibility!” A shake of his head emphasized his point. “The synergy is unbreakable. To be an accomplished blacksmith, one must also be an accomplished miner!”
Raynn nodded slowly, absorbing the idea. While she had some ability to find raw ores herself, she had often bought what she needed, as her father had. Galvan seemed to imply that mining the ores oneself was also an important part of the process though. Considering, she realized that extracting a mineral from the earth and smelting it herself did indeed give her a better understanding of its behavior.
As Galvan led her through the surrounding hills, he showed her how to find and extract veins of mithril and truesilver, continuing to expound on the unfamiliar minerals. “It is said that truesilver is stronger and more durable than mithril. Galvan does not disagree with this assessment of the minerals, but contrary to its name, truesilver is not true! Mithril is a far nobler mineral!”
As Raynn tried to follow the Dwarf’s assessment of the different metals, Galvan’s thick fingers indicated where to direct her pick in an exposed vein of slick, silvery ore. “Regardless, for this lesson you will need to extract the great silver deceiver, Raynn.”
Along with the ores themselves, he also taught her how to identify the raw gems within the ores, citrine and others, and extract them carefully. “The harvesting of precious gems is of utmost importance to our craft, Raynn.” She listened attentively, following his directions with trepidation. She had spotted similar, less potent gems in the ores in Elwynn Forest and Dun Morogh, but had never mastered the art of extracting them.
A thrill ran through her as an intact gem fell free under the delicate taps of her mining pick. Retrieving the freshly dislodged dull orange gem, Galvan held it up admiringly, telling her, “Few gems are more precious than the #citrine. The magical properties we imbue into our goods are amplified greatly by the presence of citrine.”
The sun was lowering in the west now, leaving the jungle floor in long, dark shadows, and making it difficult to see the ores, so they turned back to the small camp. It had been a long day, but the afternoon’s work had been satisfying, as purely physical activity always was to Raynn.
“Galvan has taught you the fundamentals now,” the Dwarf declared. “Now, it is up to you to master these minerals. Tomorrow you will continue your search in these hills, and bring your findings to Galvan.”
Her head spinning with the flurry of information, Raynn accepted the Dwarf’s directive, as he led them back. She took note of the nearby landmarks, certain that she would be spending a lot of time in the green hills of Stranglethorn in the near future.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Kam and Raynn report to Shaw
- Shaw identifies visitor
- Shaw asks Raynn for details, keeps her talking
- Eventually, he nods, apparently reaching some sort of conclusion
- (Shaw recognizes hint of Dwarven accent in her voice, along with others; perhaps a hint of Theramore)
- More immediate matters though - he sends them to Trias at the cheese shop</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn nodded stiffly. The penetrating glances she occasionally caught from the rogue set her on edge already. The spy-master would be even more curious, and perceptive, she thought, forcing her body to move forward steadily and not betray her nerves. She shouldn’t be afraid. She was proud of her upbringing, as unconventional as it may have been.
But explaining it…she would have to admit her actions in Southshore. To explain that, she would have to explain what Grom and Thrall had meant to her. She closed her eyes briefly, swallowing hard against the myriad of emotions that thoughts of Grom always brought. Explaining would mean delving into the twisting, intertwining threads of herself, Grom, Thrall, and her parents. And that day, she did not want to relive, even in her own mind, let alone out loud.
As her thoughts drifted too close to painful memories, Raynn pushed the past back to the darkest reaches of her mind. Longing for the escape of pure physicality, she cast a wistful glance at the training yard on the other side of the grassy lawn. The dull thud of iron meeting wood echoed across the lawn as several other young warriors honed their movements against the training dummies; Ander’s rough voice barked commands to those who didn’t meet his satisfaction.
However, it was a different type of skirmish that Raynn approached now, as they entered the less familiar of the two buildings. It appeared to be a mirror image of the barracks where she honed her fighting ability. The atmosphere was the complete opposite though.
Despite the sunlight pouring in through the front windows, the room seemed filled with drifting shadows. A cloying scent pervaded the air, reminiscent of Kamery’s poisons. The sensation of unseen eyes made her muscles tense, as they crossed the seemingly empty lower room and started up the staircase at the back of the building. In the hush that shrouded the building, her heavy, iron-clad footsteps echoed stridently.
Kamery led the way with the ease of familiarity—up the stairs, across a narrow balcony, and up a second, spiral, set of stairs. At the top, in a small tower chamber, Matthias Shaw waited, standing in front of the modest desk that occupied the left side of the circular room.
The desk, like the room itself, was made from plain, solid oak. The warm brown color and rich texture of the wood gave the room a comfortable atmosphere. Across from the desk, an open window looked out over the lawn outside, letting in fresh air and the faint sounds of the martial activities below.
The spy-master himself was reassuringly ordinary-looking, with neatly trimmed sandy brown hair, mustache, and goatee; his face was uncovered, although Raynn felt sure he must own at least one bandanna. He wore brown leather, trimmed in blue, rather than the black favored by most of the building’s occupants.
Shaw gave Kamery a brief nod of greeting as they crested the final step, then stepped forward with an outstretched hand, to greet Raynn.
“Raynn, I presume?” His voice was warm and friendly, as were his blue eyes. “Kamery told me about your role in the Deadmines,” he added in explanation. “We appreciate your help in neutralizing the threat of VanCleef.”
Raynn nodded in acceptance. His warm manner put her off-balance. She wondered who he meant by “we”—it had seemed to include more than just himself and Kamery.
Shaw’s head tilted slightly to one side, as he asked, “What brings you here now?” He glanced at Kamery curiously. “Were you able to follow up your lead to the Stockades? Was Thedd useful?” His voice was well-modulated, but some undercurrent made Raynn think that he already suspected the answer.
With a faint smile, Raynn shook her head as she replied, “Thedd was uncooperative.” She felt her voice harden, as she remembered the Defias lieutenant disorienting her and striking down Carolyn, and beside her she felt Kamery stiffen also. If not for Elthas… Pushing the thought aside, she concluded, “We helped to subdue the Stockades. Warden Thelwater told me about Thedd’s recent visitor.”
She held out the Warden’s hastily penned note. Shaw hadn’t missed their tension, and he nodded in understanding, as he accepted the scrap of paper. Unfolding the note, he quickly scanned it, his eyes tightening slightly. Returning his attention to Raynn, the spy-master spoke thoughtfully, “Tell me everything Thelwater said.”
Raynn recounted the conversation with the surly warden. Shaw’s eyes stayed on her as she spoke, and she found herself remembering Kamery’s comment about her accent when they had first met. She tried to keep her voice steady and neutral. Shaw asked several questions for clarification—more than necessary, she thought, growing increasingly uncomfortable under his scrutiny. Eventually though, the spy-master seemed satisfied.
“I know who this man is.” Shaw frowned thoughtfully. “His name is not Maelik. Another alias he goes by is Marzon, but that is likely not his true name either. Regardless, he is an assassin, currently under the employ of Lord Gregor Lescovar, a lord of shady reputation, even among the corruption of the nobility of Stormwind.”
Raynn absorbed the information, her mind spinning. A noble, having ties with the Defias?
Shaw continued speaking. “Kamery, head downstairs to Jasper; I believe you may be interested in some of his new wares. Raynn, a moment?” His gentle smile was friendly and inviting, but his eyes seemed to require acquiescence.
A twitch of her eyebrow indicated Kamery’s surprise at the dismissal, but she nodded and complied, leaving Raynn alone with Shaw in the small room. Moving to the window, Shaw looked out over the lawn below for a moment as Raynn tried to steady her breathing, suppressing the urge to run. She wasn’t one to flee from a fight, but this wasn’t the type of combat that she was used to.
Finally, Shaw turned back to her, with an understanding smile. “I apologize for my curiosity. It often gets the better of me,” he admitted. Gesturing broadly towards the open window and the city beyond, he elaborated. “I have a kingdom’s safety to watch out for.”
Raynn frowned, protesting, “I’m not—”
Shaw interrupted her, “I know. You’re not a threat. But I admit, your unconventional style drew my curiosity.” He paused, as if deciding what to say next. Raynn waited silently, now curious herself. “Your accent…Lordaeron born?”
Raynn nodded tightly.
“And you’ve spent time with the Dwarves,” Shaw added, studying her.
This, she could answer fairly truthfully, so she offered him that, hoping it would be enough. “I’m studying with the blacksmiths in Ironforge.”
Shaw nodded, accepting that for now. His eyes told her that he knew it went deeper, but he didn’t probe.
With another apologetic smile, he returned to business. “Without VanCleef and Thedd’s testimonies, it will be difficult to see Lescovar brought to justice. He is a noble, and well-connected, which effectively makes him above the law. You’ll need to find another way. I loathe to do so, but there is someone I know that will aid us. Seek out Elling Trias, in the Trade District.”
It was a dismissal, and Raynn accepted it with relief. Nodding, she turned down the stairs to find Kamery and rejoin the others.</Text>

            <Title>How?</Title>
            <Text>Watching Raynn lead the way through the foothills with easy confidence, Bryna realized, She knows where she is going. She’s lived here.
“She lived here a few years ago,” Jaina had said in Theramore. 
A few years ago? Jaina left Lordaeron for Kalimdor five years ago. She would have sailed from somewhere near here.
“You traveled to Kalimdor with Jaina?” Bryna asked.
She startled them all, of course. Raynn seemed to be considering the question carefully.
“No,” she eventually answered.
“But then, how—”
Kamery interrupted Bryna’s next question with a sharp gesture. “It doesn’t matter,” the rogue said. “She’s here now.”
The two had reached some sort of agreement, Bryna realized. But her mind kept working. The regular voyages between the continents, even the portal connections to Darnassus and Theramore, those are all too recent, within the last couple of years. I don’t think there were any other crossings back then. But the Horde first appeared in Kalimdor five years ago; they must have set sail around the same time as Jaina.
Having eliminated every other travel possibility, Bryna felt a chill run through her at the logical conclusion. It only opened up even more questions, of course—she can’t have been more than fourteen!—but she felt a new respect and understanding for the stern warrior. No wonder this is so personal for her.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Varian asks Broll, Kamery, and Elthas to go protect Anduin
- Shaw includes himself too
- They arrive at the Keep
- Shaw introduces them to Anduin</Synopsis>
            <Text>While they absorbed that information, Varian pushed his chair back abruptly and stood. “Enough talk. We must act quickly.” He looked from Broll to Kamery and Elthas. “The three of you did well in retrieving Ironfoe. I would have you do the same here, to protect my son.” All three nodded their assent. Passing behind the King, Kamery and Elthas made their way to the door.
Shaw stood also. “I will accompany them, and see if we might sway Bolvar to aid us.”
Varian’s jaw tightened as he nodded. “Do not endanger Anduin, if Bolvar truly is ensorcelled.”
Shaw nodded, and the four of them filtered out of the cottage. The sun was still shining high overhead, and the branches overhead cast shifting shadows as they swayed in the light wind. With a parting glance at the overgrown vegetable patch, Kamery turned and followed Shaw and the druids northward.
Although the main gates of Stormwind were well-guarded, the city patrols were no match for the shadows that the four could hide in. They easily traversed the city, following the canal-side to their destination. Kamery paid little heed to the familiar cobblestones and white stone buildings, but she noticed Broll looking around with interest.
The druid’s curiosity became focus as they entered the Keep, Shaw leading them through the painting-lined marble halls. They passed by the throne room, but did not enter. As she looked in, Kamery saw three people standing on the dais in front of the throne.
A near duplicate of the Varian that she knew stood in the middle. He had no scars though, and his clothes were fine silks and velvets. To either side of him stood the noblewoman and paladin who must be Katrana Prestor and Bolvar Fordragon.
Shaw beckoned them onwards, and two turns later, they reached a modest study in the back of the Keep. Building onto the mental map that she had of the Keep, Kamery decided that they must be near the courtyard and library that they had visited earlier.
As they entered the bookshelf-lined room and Shaw emerged from the shadows, the young blond boy within barely startled. Kamery was impressed; he must be used to Shaw’s comings and goings.
“My Prince.” Shaw bowed. “Allow me to introduce my associates, Broll, Elthas.” The druids both shifted out of feline form, which naturally pulled them into sight. They also bowed to the young prince. “Kamery.” She followed suit, bowing to the wide-eyed Prince.
The boy nodded his head gravely in greeting. “Are we in danger?” he asked. Perceptive, indeed.
Shaw nodded. “Please, remain here for your safety. I must see to those in the throne room.”
Anduin’s jaw tightened in a manner reminiscent of his father, but he nodded his agreement and Shaw left the study, beckoning Kamery to follow him.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Elthas recognizes Varian's scent
- Bry tells them of her dismissal at Stormwind
- Varian is angry</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Bryna’s carpet drifted to a stop, she took in the scene before her. Her friends were gathered at one end of a table that held a map of the area. She barely glanced at the map; she had committed the maps of Azeroth to memory years ago.
Next to Kamery stood the commander of the outpost, Marshal Maxwell, she now knew; she had seen him at a distance before Helendis had sent them on this ridiculous errand. Up close, he looked rather frazzled and she wondered if he would react any better than Solomon had to her news. They were watching her intently as she and Elthas approached.
Across from Kamery and Maxwell were two others, but in her disgruntlement, she ignored the new faces for the moment. Turning to Raynn, she exclaimed, “You were right, Raynn. Lady Prestor is very unpleasant.” Raynn looked startled at the sudden pronouncement, but nodded her agreement. Just saying it made Bryna feel better, and she began to take note of her surroundings.
Her friends stood straighter than usual, tension evident in their posture and expressions. Kamery was giving her a hard look at her indirect admission to having gone to Stormwind. Something else had them on edge too. Have they found out what we were really sent here for?
Beside her, Elthas had shifted, unusually, into his feline form. He had told her how unpleasant he found the ash and dust of the area even as a cheetah, and she knew that the panther’s senses were even more sensitive.  The black panther was edging closer to the nearer of the newcomers with an intent look on his feline face.
Looking up, curious at the druid’s interest, Bryna blinked in surprise. The man was, unmistakably, King Varian Wrynn. Not dressed as a King of Stormwind, and sporting new scars on his face, but certainly the King. Otherwise occupied? What is going on here?
“What of Lady Prestor?” The King asked, having heard her comment, of course. Bryna cringed inwardly, realizing that he probably had a very different view of the woman. Prestor had been one of his primary advisors, after all.
Shaking off her gaffe, she told him briefly about her journey to Lakeshire and Stormwind, and the dismissal there. She left out the part about disguising herself; that particular ability was something she liked to keep to herself.
As she spoke, she vaguely realized that Elthas was creeping closer and closer behind the King. The King’s companion, an antlered druid, also seemed to notice. He cleared his throat meaningfully.
“Manners, young one,” the older druid reprimanded her younger companion. Elthas looked up startled, and backed away.
Meanwhile, Varian had absorbed her words. His brows lowered over tight eyes and his voice was furious. “Fordragon should not have dismissed this concern so easily! He sent no help?” His hand, resting on the edge of the table, clenched into a fist.</Text>

            <Text>Meanwhile in the ash-covered plains just outside Morgan’s Vigil, Carolyn followed Raynn and Kamery as they pushed back the black dragon-kin in the area. The warrior and rogue had cleared a wide swath through the swarming whelplings and lesser dragonspawns with their sharp blades, and Carolyn was keeping busy, not with healing the proficient pair, but with removing what scales she could salvage from their fallen foes.
She caught Kamery’s eyes on her, and smiled at her sister. “Elthas showed me,” the priestess explained. “Leather comes in useful sometimes.”
Kamery blinked, holding up one leather-clad arm. “Yes, I’m aware. I didn’t think you liked the weight.”
Carolyn chuckled. “El wears it.” She lifted the bottom of her robe slightly, to show the bottom of one foot, showing off the sturdy leather sole of her lightweight boot. “I use a bit.”
“I see.” Kamery’s tone didn’t quite reflect that understanding. She thought for a moment. “Can you make armor with it?”
Carolyn shook her head, feeling a strand of hair loosen from her knot. “No, but El can.” She tucked the loose strand back into place as Raynn approached.
“Had enough?” the warrior asked. Her eyes were bright with satisfaction at the physical exertions of the day. Several new smudges of ash marred her shield, but Carolyn knew they would be polished away by that night.
“Just comparing armor,” the priestess said, teasingly. Raynn’s self-made plate armor was her pride and joy, and neither Carolyn’s robe nor Kamery’s leathers could come close to comparing. Remembering Raynn’s past history with Orcs, she asked, “We may end up facing the Blackrock here. Are you alright with this?”
Raynn nodded. “They could have come with us. They didn’t. They made their choice.”
Kamery gestured at the distant black dragon-kin. “Perhaps not entirely.”
Raynn’s eyes followed the rogue’s gesture, growing distant. “Grom broke free.” She paused for a moment, then her jaw tightened. “We can’t let them stop us from protecting Stormwind.”</Text>

            <Title>16-05-15-L0-Blood Oath</Title>
            <Text>The air in the internment camp was thick with tension, a palpable sense of despair hanging over the dilapidated structures. The orcs, once proud warriors, were now shackled and lethargic, prisoners of a war not of their making. Raynn's parents, among the few who had learned the orcish language, stood defiantly, voices raised in support of the orcs' release.

Thrall, the young orc Warchief, stood at the forefront, demanding the freedom of his people. Raynn's parents' pleas resonated with him, finding allies in the most unexpected places. The other humans, however, were not swayed by their arguments. Anger and prejudice fueled their violence, and the once-supportive words became a death sentence.

From her hiding place, Raynn watched in horror as her parents were mercilessly beaten, their bodies wracked with pain. Her mother lay unconscious, a pool of blood forming around her head. The brutality of the scene etched itself into Raynn's memory, fueling a mixture of fear, rage, and helplessness.

Just as the situation seemed unbearable, Grom Hellscream, a formidable orc warrior, arrived. He surveyed the grim scene, recognizing the futility of saving Raynn's parents. Her father, with a strength born of desperation, managed to convey a plea for his daughter's safety. Grom, remembering his own young son, nodded solemnly.

As Raynn's father took his last breath, Grom turned to the unconscious mother. The air was heavy with sorrow and the weight of a promise. Thrall arrived, witnessing the aftermath of the tragedy.

&quot;We need to find a human child,&quot; Grom declared, surprising Thrall with the unexpected request.

Thrall hesitated, unsure about bringing a human child into the midst of orc refugees and warriors. Grom, however, insisted that it was a blood oath – a matter of honor that could not be ignored.

It was then that Raynn, tears streaking her dirt-stained face, emerged from her hiding place to suggest a solution.

&quot;Take me to the dwarves in Dun Modr.&quot; Her voice trembled with emotion, but she regarded the orcs steadily. &quot;My father fought alongside them before. They'll keep me safe.&quot;

Grom and Thrall exchanged glances, considering the proposition. The idea seemed viable, and the promise made by Grom to Raynn's dying father lingered in the air.

&quot;Very well,&quot; Grom agreed, his voice carrying the weight of responsibility. &quot;We'll take you to the dwarves in Dun Modr.&quot;

And so, amidst the sorrowful landscape of the internment camp, a pact was formed – a promise made to a dying man, sealed with the fate of a young girl who would find an unexpected sanctuary among the dwarves.

---

The air in the internment camp hung heavy with tension as the sun dipped low over the Arathi Highlands. Lysandra, Ellis, and Raynn approached the camp, a familiar routine tinged with apprehension. The camp sprawled before them, a collection of ramshackle tents and guarded fences, a temporary prison for the orcish captives.

As they entered, a distant rumble signaled the arrival of Thrall, Orgrim, Grom, and the orcish army. Dust stirred as they approached, a harbinger of the storm that was about to descend upon the camp.

At the entrance, Thrall's voice thundered, demanding the release of the orc prisoners. Fear gripped the humans within the camp, their anger building as they defiantly refused to let the orcs go. Among them, Lysandra and Ellis stepped forward, voices raised in favor of a peaceful resolution.

The mood soured swiftly. The camp's inhabitants, driven by fear and hatred, turned on Lysandra and Ellis. Fists and weapons found their mark, and the couple was beaten mercilessly. In the shadows, Raynn watched, the horror of the scene etching itself into her memory.

As the chaos unfolded, the orcish army, led by Grom and Thrall, stormed the camp. The clash of metal, the roars of orcs, and the screams of humans merged into a symphony of chaos. Near the end of the tumultuous battle, Grom, his massive figure cutting through the haze of conflict, discovered Lysandra unconscious and Ellis barely clinging to life.

Grom, a conflicted expression on his face, recognized the inevitability of their demise. In an act of mercy, he offered Ellis a swift death. Ellis, battered and broken, seized the moment to make a final plea. With sincerity etched in his weakening voice, he extracted a promise from Grom to find and protect Raynn.

Unknown to them, Raynn had been a hidden witness to the unfolding tragedy. Grom, now bound by an unspoken blood oath, fulfilled his promise, ending the lives of Ellis and Lysandra.

As the echoes of the battle subsided, Thrall arrived, a witness to the aftermath. Grom, grim-faced, informed Thrall of the need to find a human girl. An argument ensued, Grom invoking a blood oath that Thrall contested.

In a moment of tense compromise, Raynn stepped forward, proposing that they could leave her with the dwarves at Dun Modr, not far away. Grom, sensing a solution that would honor his promise and protect Raynn, reluctantly agreed.

Together, Grom, Thrall, and Raynn rode to the Thandol Span, leaving behind the scene of both tragedy and compromise. Behind them, the orc army, under Ogrim Doomhammer, prepared for the next internment camp.

As Grom and Thrall watched Raynn cross the span, a new chapter began for the young human, accepted by the dwarves of Dun Modr. Grom and Thrall, bound by duty and the consequences of their choices, rejoined the orc army, leaving behind the scars of the internment camp and carrying the weight of promises made and broken.

—

In the shadow of a battered tent, Raynn crouched low, her heart pounding like the distant drums of war. Hidden, she strained to understand the guttural orcish words exchanged between Grom and Thrall. The aching bruises on her parents' faces served as a brutal reminder of the cost of understanding, of bearing witness.

Thrall, stern and resolute, his green-skinned face etched with determination, questioned Grom. &quot;What has transpired here?&quot; Thrall's gaze flickered towards the lifeless forms of Ellis and Lysandra.

Grom, his towering frame silhouetted against the waning light, responded with a heavy solemnity, &quot;They were near death, Thrall. Beaten. I offered the man a quick end. Before he died, he made me swear to find and protect his child.&quot;

Thrall's gaze narrowed, concern etching his features. &quot;A child, Grom? In the midst of our warband? It is no place for a human. They won't survive among us. We are on a mission to liberate our people.&quot;

Grom, undeterred, spoke with a determination that echoed through the camp, &quot;Thrall, it's a matter of honor. A blood oath. I won't break it.&quot;

Thrall, torn between duty and compassion, hesitated, the gravity of the situation sinking in. Grom's next words cut through the air like a blade. &quot;A blood oath, Thrall.&quot;

Acknowledging the weight of Grom's oath, Thrall gave a reluctant nod. &quot;Very well, Grom. But the risks are great. We must be cautious.&quot;

As Grom and Thrall rode towards the Thandol Span, Raynn's fate became intertwined with theirs. The promise of protection echoed in the air, a pledge forged in the crucible of war. The journey ahead, obscured by uncertainty, held the echoes of the orcish code of honor and the weight of promises made under the shadow of death.

—

In the shadow of a battered tent, Grom Hellscream stood tall, his brow furrowed as the weight of his recent actions settled upon him. Before him lay the lifeless forms of Ellis and Lysandra, a grim tableau of the cost of liberation. Thrall's questioning gaze bore into him, demanding an explanation for the mercy killings.

&quot;They were near death, Thrall,&quot; Grom grumbled, his voice heavy with the burden of the recent events. &quot;Beaten. I offered the man a quick end. Before he died, he made me swear to find and protect his child.&quot;

Thrall's expression shifted to a mix of concern and skepticism. &quot;A child, Grom? In the midst of our warband? It is no place for a human. They won't survive among us. We are on a mission to liberate our people.&quot;

But Grom, anchored by the weight of a promise, held firm. &quot;Thrall, it's a matter of honor. A blood oath. I won't break it.&quot;

As Thrall hesitated, Grom's thoughts delved into the gravity of the situation. The blood oath weighed heavily on his conscience, a solemn commitment made in the midst of suffering. &quot;A blood oath, Thrall,&quot; he reiterated, knowing that such pledges were not to be taken lightly.

Thrall, acknowledging the solemnity of the oath, finally relented. &quot;Very well, Grom. But the risks are great. We must be cautious.&quot;

As they rode towards the Thandol Span, Grom's mind echoed with the echoes of the orcish code of honor. The promise to protect Raynn reverberated within him, a pledge forged in the crucible of war, setting the course for a journey fraught with uncertainty and duty.

—

In the dimming light, Thrall surveyed the aftermath of battle, his piercing green eyes settling on the lifeless forms of Ellis and Lysandra. Confusion and concern etched across his features as he sought answers from Grom, who stood resolute beside him.

&quot;What has transpired here?&quot; Thrall inquired, his gaze lingering on the battered bodies.

Grom's response resonated through the air, heavy with the weight of recent actions. &quot;They were near death, Thrall. Beaten. I offered the man a quick end. Before he died, he made me swear to find and protect his child.&quot;

Thrall's brow furrowed, his eyes narrowing as he observed the state of the fallen humans. A child? The realization of the severity of their injuries cut through him. &quot;A child, Grom? In the midst of our warband? It is no place for a human. They won't survive among us. We are on a mission to liberate our people.&quot;

Grom's determination clashed with Thrall's skepticism. &quot;Thrall, it's a matter of honor. A blood oath. I won't break it.&quot;

The gravity of the situation bore down on Thrall as he hesitated. His thoughts echoed in the silence, grappling with the conflicting demands of duty and compassion. The revelation of a blood oath added a layer of solemnity to the decision at hand. &quot;A blood oath, Thrall,&quot; Grom reiterated, emphasizing the sacredness of the vow.

Thrall, acknowledging the weight of the oath, finally relented. &quot;Very well, Grom. But the risks are great. We must be cautious.&quot;

As they rode towards the Thandol Span, Thrall's mind wrestled with the implications of their newfound charge. The promise to protect a human child reverberated within him, setting the tone for the journey ahead, marked by uncertainty and duty.

            <Synopsis>- Kamery picks locks in the jail
- Find Windsor, he's lost all hope
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Thus far, they had met little opposition, but now, they encountered several Dark Iron watchers. Kamery watched with an inward sigh as Varian and Raynn charged into battle immediately. Broll, shifting forms to a fierce bear, joined them readily, with Elthas’s panther close behind. Bryna’s frost-bolts flew at the Dark Iron Dwarves, but often landing late as they fell under the assault of the others.
Healing the warriors, Carolyn gave her sister a glance, meeting her eyes with a meaningful nod of her head to the deeper parts of the cavern. Kamery smiled under her bandanna, acknowledging the silent message. Silently, she slipped into the shadows to pass around behind the melee. As she passed Elthas, the feline druid took notice. As his current foe fell, he also joined her in the shadows, and they padded silently deeper into the network of caves.
Gradually, the sounds of combat faded behind them, replaced by the increasingly more numerous footsteps of Dark Iron soldiers. Several twists and turns later, they reached a lightly guarded antechamber. Directly ahead, a wide hallway led into a much larger cavern. To their left, a second tunnel led to the side, its opening blocked by widely spaced iron bars. Beyond the bars, they could see a reddish glow and hear the regular sound of boot-falls.
Knowing that they would cover more ground separately, Kamery gestured to Elthas that they should split up. With a nod, Elthas trotted towards the iron grate. His feline body slipped fluidly between the bars. Kamery smiled as she made her way up the wide hallway to the larger chamber ahead.
The room was filled with small groups of Dark Iron Dwarves, and the sounds of their chatter and heavy boots echoed against the domed ceiling. Hugging the walls of the wide cavern, Kamery noted passageways leading in at least six directions, in addition to the wide entry she had emerged from.
Deciding to start logically, Kamery took the first passageway to the right. The way curved around to the left. The outer wall, on her right, was lined with heavy iron doors, fastened with solid locks. The rough walls and uneven floor raised questions about the architectural choices of Franclorn Forgewright. Rough stone tunnels? How much of an architect was this Forgewright anyway? Although his tomb was ornate. A prison may not have been a central feature of his city planning. A prison is probably exactly what we want though. 
Guards were stationed at regular intervals along the corridor, but not so close to one another to interfere if she chose to incapacitate one. Curious as to the contents of the cells, she did just that, using the hilt of her dagger to stun the nearby Dark Iron.
Deftly picking the lock, she opened the cell. Disappointingly, it was empty. The musty, undisturbed air within left her frowning. Continuing stealthily down the tunnel, she swiftly picked the lock of the next locked door. This cell contained a rather upset Iron Dwarf, who didn’t seem at all grateful for the release. Her words to Broll the previous day hadn’t been bluster though, and Kamery dispatched him easily.
She slipped back into the rough-hewn hallway, glancing in both directions to ensure that the scuffle hadn’t drawn attention. I wonder if El is finding anything more visually appealing.
It wasn’t until the fourth cell that she found what—or rather, who—she was looking for. A Human male sat on a bench at the back of the cell. He barely glanced up as she entered. His sandy brown hair and beard were short, showing signs of once being neatly trimmed, but were now rumpled and messy. He was dressed in only a white undershirt and torn blue breeches.
Closing the door silently behind her, Kamery asked, “Marshal Windsor?”
The man glanced up morosely, then returned his gaze to his hands, loosely folded between his knees. “What does it matter?”
Frowning at his attitude, Kamery pressed forward. “We had heard that you were investigating the Black Dragon influence in Stormwind. We need your information for Highlord Fordragon.” She decided it was best to leave the King’s involvement out for the moment.
Windsor sighed deeply. “Bolvar is a blind fool,” he muttered, almost to himself. “Proof stands two feet from him and he does not see it.” He looked up at her, his blue eyes devoid of emotion. “As for my data, it’s lost. Gone. Unrecoverable. Ironfoe too.”
The haunting emptiness in his eyes shook her to the core. He had lost all hope; the loss of his research, and of his family’s heirloom weapon, had been too much. Kamery couldn’t even convince him to leave the cell with her.
As she returned to the passageway, Kamery idly twirled her dagger in her right hand. The temptation to throw it at the wall rose in her, but she resisted. The stone would only dull the blade, and the sound would draw unwanted attention.
Continuing up the tunnel, she realized that it had curved around enough that she was almost back at the central cavern. The antechamber where she had separated from Elthas lay across the room now. From that direction, she could barely distinguish the sounds of battle mingling with the heavy tread of the guards’ iron boots and the clamor of several conversations. Luckily these Dwarves seem more interested in chatting with each other; they haven’t noticed Varian and Raynn’s arrival yet. I’d better go deliver the bad news.</Text>

            <Title>Bolvar's Medallion</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bolvar's broken medallion is found
- It could be the key to Onyxia's lair
- Broll suggests the Green Dragonflight</Synopsis>
            <Text>As he held his son tightly, Varian looked up, over the boy’s head, his gaze finding Carolyn. The dark blue eyes swirled with emotions—gratitude, confusion, and so much more than she couldn’t identify. “Thank you.” His voice was rough with emotion, but no longer held the raw edge that she had become accustomed to.
Smiling, Carolyn shook her head in disbelief. “I wasn’t even sure if it would work,” she confessed. “I only guided the magic. The source was Onyxia’s spell.”
At the mention of the dragon’s name, Varian’s face hardened, his jaw clenching and his eyes turning steely. He rose, a King once again, although one hand lingered on Anduin’s shoulder as the boy also turned to face them. “The brood-mother is still out there, somewhere. We must find her and eliminate the threat once and for all.”
Nods of agreement greeted his statement, but accompanied by confusion on how that would be accomplished. With the dragon gone now, they began to gather in a loose circle facing the King and his son who now stood in front of the throne.
From behind Carolyn, Jaina stepped forward to the priestess’s right to answer at least some of their questions. “We have discovered her lair in Dustwallow Marsh, south of Theramore. The entrance, however, is barred with powerful spells attuned to the Black Dragonflight. I have been unable to break it; I believe it would take a source of her own magic.”
Carolyn felt a chill run through her at the news. When they had been in Theramore previously, they had seen a firemane drake, but she hadn’t realized just how close the brood-mother’s lair had been. Kamery’s hand tightening on her own told her that her sister shared her reaction.
At Jaina’s news, Varian’s brows lowered, and he glanced questioningly at Mathias Shaw, standing on the other side of Anduin. The spy-master shook his head helplessly, his face reflecting his frustration with his uncharacteristic lack of knowledge. However, beyond Shaw, Bolvar Fordragon turned thoughtfully, striding over to where he had fallen when Onyxia had transformed. Bending, he picked up a golden medallion from the step of the dais.
As he returned to the group, Fordragon held out the medallion. Twisted strands of gold wove around a dark onyx gemstone, now cracked down the middle. “I believe she used this to control me,” the paladin lowered his eyes at the admission of his fallibility. “I felt my mind clear when it broke.”
Stepping forward, Jaina took the medallion; there was an unspoken agreement that the arch-mage should be first to examine it. Turning it over in her hands, she nodded thoughtfully. “It could be used as a focus, if it could be repaired.” Her voice was a question though, not an answer.
Jaina handed the medallion to Varian, who took it gingerly. Although the Shadows had receded, Carolyn wondered if he was still feeling the echoes of the dragon’s spell. Shadow magic, she knew, had a tendency to linger in the mind.
“Mathias, I would ask that you take care of this investigation.” The King hesitated, glancing down at Anduin. “I would like to take some time with my son.” His voice broke slightly at the last. Shaw nodded, stepping out in front of the Prince to take the medallion before returning to his place at the boy’s side.
Anduin, his blue eyes wide throughout the exchange, looked up at the medallion in Shaw’s hand, then around at the gathered group. He seemed to relax when his eyes passed over Raynn.
From Carolyn’s left, Broll stepped forward. “Perhaps another Dragonflight could be of assistance,” he offered. “The druids in the Moonglade may be able to commune with the Green Dragonflight.” Glancing at Elthas, standing beyond him, the older druid smiled in invitation. “Join me, young one?”</Text>

            <Text>In the lush and untamed landscape of Un'Goro Crater, the group of five adventurers found themselves immersed in a vibrant world teeming with prehistoric wonders. The air was thick with the sounds of exotic creatures, and the scent of ancient foliage lingered in every breeze.

Their journey led them to Torwa Pathfinder, a seasoned hunter seeking assistance in his quest to challenge the mighty devilsaurs that roamed the region. Eager for adventure, they joined forces with Torwa, engaging in thrilling battles against the colossal beasts that ruled Un'Goro.

After proving their mettle, they continued their exploration northward, eventually reaching Marshal's Refuge. The bustling outpost became their temporary home, providing a base for their endeavors in the mysterious crater.

Carolyn, fueled by a hunter's zeal, took a particular interest in hunting devilsaurs. Her proficiency in combat and healing allowed her to face the formidable creatures solo, harvesting valuable leather that she either sold or shared with Elthas for his leatherworking endeavors.

Kamery and Raynn, always resourceful, dedicated their time to gathering materials. Raynn, with her mining skills, delved into the earth to extract precious ores for her blacksmithing pursuits. Kamery, on the other hand, scoured the landscape for herbs, both for her alchemical craft and to contribute to their shared resources.

Bryna, while slightly disappointed by the scarcity of cloth scraps for her tailoring, made the most of her skills with materials collected in Zul'Gurub. Her resourcefulness allowed her to maintain a healthy stockpile, ensuring she could craft and contribute as needed.

In this wild and primal land, their skills complemented each other, creating a harmonious balance that would serve them well as they continued to unravel the mysteries of Un'Goro Crater. The untamed beauty of the region mirrored the camaraderie and shared purpose of the group, forging bonds as strong as the ancient trees that towered over them.

The warm glow of the campfire danced in the cool night air as the group gathered around in the makeshift circle of logs and stones in Marshal's Refuge. The sounds of Un'Goro's nocturnal creatures added a rhythmic backdrop to the crackling flames.

Carolyn, sitting cross-legged, adjusted her grip on her staff and spoke up, her eyes flickering with the fire's reflection. &quot;Well, seems we've made ourselves quite at home here. What's our plan for the next few days?&quot;

Elthas, leaning against a rock, raised an eyebrow. &quot;I've heard rumors of strange energies emanating from the eastern reaches of the crater. Might be worth checking out.&quot;

Kamery, meticulously sharpening her daggers, chimed in. &quot;I've gathered information that points to some elemental activity in the central parts. It's on the radar but might be best to approach cautiously.&quot;

Raynn, leaning back on her elbows, glanced at the others. &quot;I've got my eyes on the western side. There are reports of ancient titan ruins and potentially some powerful artifacts. Could be worth investigating.&quot;

Bryna, idly toying with a piece of cloth, added, &quot;And there's always more exploring to do. Who knows what we might stumble upon?&quot;

As the conversation flowed, they learned more about each other's backgrounds and experiences. Carolyn shared tales of her time in Darnassus, and Elthas spoke of his druidic training in the serene realms of Teldrassil. Kamery shared snippets of her covert missions for SI:7, and Raynn recounted her adventures across Azeroth.

Bryna, always the jester of the group, interjected with humor, lightening the mood. &quot;Well, I don't know about you all, but I'm looking forward to more adventures, and maybe a bit more cloth for my tailoring.&quot;

Amidst the laughter and camaraderie, the group felt a growing sense of unity, bound by the shared excitement of the unknown that lay ahead in Un'Goro Crater. The night wore on, and the embers of the campfire cast shadows that danced across their faces, etching memories of friendship and adventure in the untamed wilderness.

---

Under the lush canopy of Un'Goro Crater, the group found themselves in a rhythm of exploration and training. The days blurred together as they ventured deeper into the dense jungle, each member showcasing their unique skills and talents.

At Fire Plume Ridge, they faced the fiery elementals that roamed the volcanic terrain. The air crackled with the sounds of combat as spells were cast, blades clashed, and the primal forces of nature collided with the arcane. Elthas, in his feline form, prowled with agility, occasionally leaping into action to test his claws against the molten adversaries.

During their solo ventures, each member uncovered hidden corners of the crater, collecting herbs, ores, and other resources. Carolyn's staff glowed with arcane energy as she effortlessly dealt with the local wildlife, showcasing a mastery of both magic and martial prowess. Kamery's stealthy approach allowed her to navigate the terrain unseen, efficiently dispatching threats with her daggers.

Raynn, clad in the sturdy armor she crafted herself, wielded her two-handed weapons with finesse, the whirling strikes of her blades cutting through the air. The sparring sessions became opportunities for skill refinement, with the occasional exchange of friendly banter.

Bryna, though less inclined to spar, brought her own flair to the group. With a flick of her fingers, she unleashed arcane bolts and bursts of magical energy, displaying a raw and untamed power that set her apart.

In the quiet moments around the campfire, Elthas remained in his feline form, curled up or prowling nearby. The crackling flames painted patterns on his sleek fur as he listened to the conversations around him. The camaraderie within the group deepened, and beneath the surface, bonds of friendship strengthened.

As the weeks passed, Un'Goro Crater became both a training ground and a sanctuary for the adventurers. The untamed wilderness echoed with the sounds of their laughter, the clash of weapons, and the whispers of magic, creating a symphony of exploration and shared experiences.

---

The lush canopy of Un'Goro Crater provided a natural arena for the anticipated sparring match between Raynn and Carolyn. The air was thick with the sounds of wildlife, the distant rumble of the volcano, and the rustling of leaves as the two companions squared off in a small clearing.

Raynn, clad in her armor, gripped a sturdy shield in one hand and a one-handed weapon in the other. The shield bore the marks of countless battles, and the weapon gleamed with a well-maintained edge. Carolyn, on the other hand, wielded a simple staff, its wood polished but lacking extravagant enchantments.

The two circled each other, eyes locked in a friendly but determined gaze. Carolyn's staff was held ready, its length providing a buffer against Raynn's weapon. Raynn, with the weight of her shield, moved with a practiced precision, ready to block and counter.

The first exchange was swift. Raynn lunged forward, shield raised, aiming to test Carolyn's defenses. Carolyn responded with a swift sidestep, her staff twirling gracefully as she avoided the oncoming strike. The staff connected with Raynn's shield, the impact resonating through the air.

Sparks flew as the two warriors engaged in a dance of strikes and parries. Raynn's shield became a steadfast barrier, blocking Carolyn's well-aimed blows. Meanwhile, Carolyn demonstrated a surprising agility, using the length of her staff to keep Raynn at a calculated distance.

The sparring match continued, each participant adapting to the other's style. Raynn's strength and resilience clashed with Carolyn's agility and finesse. As the rhythm of the battle intensified, a subtle camaraderie emerged, a silent acknowledgment of mutual respect.

With a final flourish, Raynn disarmed Carolyn, knocking the staff from her hands. Both combatants paused, breathing heavily but smiling. The clearing echoed with the sounds of the jungle returning to its usual symphony.

&quot;That was quite a match,&quot; Raynn remarked, lowering her shield.

Carolyn retrieved her staff, nodding appreciatively. &quot;You're a formidable opponent, Raynn. Your shield work is impressive.&quot;

Raynn grinned. &quot;And your staff is no slouch either. We make a good team.&quot;

As they walked back to camp together, the camaraderie between Raynn and Carolyn deepened, their first sparring match leaving behind not only the echoes of combat but also the foundation of a stronger friendship.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Face and defeat General Drakkisath
- Vaelan transforms to Vaelastrasz</Synopsis>
            <Text>With satisfaction, Kamery watched as her friend won the respect of the watching Orcs. Raynn’s understanding of their culture was impressive. She had seen the emotions in Raynn’s eyes as they had fought; so much more than just her usual protectiveness of Carolyn and her other allies.
As word of the battle spread, the halls beyond emptied. Orcs hurried past them, ignoring them, or giving them glances of mingled respect and fear. They met little resistance as they followed General Drakkisath’s trail as he retreated now, through the very upper reaches of the spire.
Across a long, narrow bridge, from which they could see the lower city far below, they reached the General’s lair. He awaited them at the far end of the long, rectangular chamber. Battling through his few remaining lesser dragon-kin defenders, they finally faced their quarry.
Drakkisath fought furiously, and they found themselves set back on their heels. His breath weapon swept over them, heating Raynn’s armor and singing Elthas’s fur, as Kamery rolled away, feeling the heat wash over her.
A roar of draconic fury halted the dragonspawn’s assault, as Vaelan transformed, becoming a massive red dragon—Vaelastrasz. He swiped out with one massive claw, knocking the General backwards.
Rearing back, Vaelastrasz loosed a fiery breath. Unlike the breath of the Black Dragonflight, his breath washed over them with rejuvenating power, bringing healing and strength.
As Vaelastrasz’s flame seared away her wounds, Raynn growled in anger. Her shield slammed into the recovering dragonspawn, sending him stumbling back again. Bryna’s frost-bolt battered the reeling General; the mage hadn’t flinched during the fiery draconic exchange.
Drakkisath fell, and Kamery gathered drops of his sizzling black blood in her strongest vials.</Text>

            <Title>Mysterious Missive</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Kamery, Bryna, Carolyn catch up to Elthas as he is returning with the letter carried by Garn Mathers
- Captain Wymor sends them to Renn McGill</Synopsis>
            <Text>Twisted, dark trees, their branches devoid of leaves, rose to all sides as Elthas loped easily back towards Sentry Point, with his precious find safely secured in his neck pouch. Captain Wymor had been right to be worried about the Defias activity; Elthas had found many of the red-bandanna-wearing ruffians swarming about the Dreadmurk Shore.
After identifying their leader, the druid had stealthily made his way into the man’s tent and searched his belongings. Amongst the detritus, he had found a letter, written in ornate script on heavy, expensive paper, which smelled faintly of perfume and something less pleasant that he couldn’t identify. The language had been formal, and imperious. The missive had caught his attention, and he had liberated it. Now he just had to hope that Wymor might know more about the ‘precious cargo’ that the unsigned letter mentioned.
As the Captain’s sentry tower came into sight, he saw a welcome sight—his three Human friends making their way up the dusty road towards the same tower. Kamery and Bryna flanked Carolyn, protectively, he thought, and the priestess herself looked a little wan, although she wore her usual peaceful smile. Elthas suspected that she had needed to use the Shadow spells after all. He wondered if they had learned anything of use, perhaps relating to the cryptic paper he carried.
Approaching the Humans, he butted his head up against Carolyn’s hand and her smile widened.
“Elthas,” her voice held mixed happiness, relief, and a hint of teasing reproach. “What trouble have you been getting into now?”
Taking a step back, he shifted out of feline form and dug into his pack for the letter. “There are Defias all along the shore. I found this. I was hoping Captain Wymor would be able to shed some light on it.”
They had continued walking as he spoke, and the Captain in question approached as he overheard his name. “Welcome back, druid. Have you found anything?”
Elthas handed the letter to Captain Wymor, and the man scanned the text. Bryna was also looking curiously at the paper. Elthas shifted back to feline form, once again noting the strange scent of the paper. It was unlike anything he had encountered before, something more than just the rich paper and ink.
“That’s expensive paper,” the mage noted. “The type that the nobles use.”
Captain Wymor nodded, handing the letter to her to peruse as he noted, “The language of these orders does suggest a wealthy or noble patron.”
Bryna nodded in agreement, as she handed the letter to Kamery, who held the note out so that Carolyn could also read it. Elthas prowled restlessly around their legs as they spoke. He was happy to have the Humans around again.
“What ‘precious cargo’ could they be talking about?” The priestess mused.
Captain Wymor shook his head as he directed them to their next move. “From these orders, it looks like the first priority of the Defias is to locate and secure whatever cargo they possessed. SI:7”—he glanced at Kamery—“has had a salvage diver named Renn McGill working out of Theramore for some time. When he heard about the shipwreck, Renn went north to dive near the islands the Defias now occupy. If we’re to beat the Defias to this cargo, we’ll need his help. Seek him out in the waters just north of the islands just offshore.”</Text>

            <Title>Epilogue</Title>
            <Text>The knock on Lily's door echoed through the quiet evening, disrupting the mundane rhythm of her everyday life. Opening the door, she was greeted by the sight of Anduin Wrynn, a figure from her past who had once stepped through a mysterious rift in the Shadowlands.

&quot;Anduin,&quot; Lily exclaimed, surprised and delighted to see him after all these years. His presence brought back a flood of memories from their initial encounter, the adventures they shared, and the uncharted connection that lingered.

Anduin smiled warmly, a mixture of nostalgia and genuine happiness in his eyes. &quot;Lily, it's been too long,&quot; he remarked, stepping into the familiar space that had once been the backdrop of their unusual meeting.

As they caught up on the lost time, Anduin shared tales of Azeroth's ongoing struggles and triumphs. Lily, in turn, recounted the chapters of her life that unfolded on Earth. The conversation flowed effortlessly, as if the years apart had merely been a brief pause in an ongoing dialogue.

In the quiet moments that followed, Lily couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the unexpected connection forged across dimensions. Anduin, too, seemed to appreciate the subtle magic of their reunion.

Before parting ways, Anduin handed Lily a small trinket – a token from Azeroth, a reminder of their shared history. &quot;For old times' sake,&quot; he said with a smile.

As Anduin bid farewell and stepped back into the unknown, Lily found herself standing at the threshold of the present and the echoes of the past. The rift that had once brought them together had, for a fleeting moment, allowed their paths to cross again, leaving Lily with a sense of wonder and a cherished connection that transcended time and distance.</Text>

            <Title>Shipwreck</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Elthas uses new sea lion form to search for clues in the shipwreck</Synopsis>
            <Text>They made their way through the swamp to the north without mishap, save for Carolyn’s robes getting snagged on a few stretching branches. Although she felt a little bad for slowing their pace, she knew that she would never be comfortable in leggings, like Kamery’s, and even less so in shorts like Bryna’s. Whimsically, she wondered why priests couldn’t shape-shift as druids could.
The druid in question was bounding ahead of them now, even more eager than usual, she thought. His exuberant spirit helped to clear the last vestiges of the Shadows from her mind and once again she found herself glad that they had met.
Skirting the Defias combing the beaches near the islands and the wreckage they could glimpse in the deeper waters, they made their way to an unoccupied part of the shoreline further north. Elthas met them at the edge of the water, standing waist-deep in the water. Carolyn looked at the druid curiously, wondering why he was out of form. His panther could swim as well as she could.
Elthas’s golden eyes were sparkling and he was smiling broadly. His attention was fully on Carolyn, as he spoke a single word, “Look!”
Her eyes widened as he shifted now, not to one of his familiar forms, but into something new—a sea lion! His sleek silver-grey form glided gracefully through the shallow water. His whiskers twitched in excitement as he twisted and turned, showing off for her, the priestess knew.
A delighted smile broke out on Carolyn’s face at the exuberant druid’s antics. Of all the druid’s abilities, she found shape-shifting the most fascinating. Realization dawning, she asked, “Is this what you returned to Darnassus to train?”
The sea lion paused, its dark, liquid eyes dancing with happiness as it faced her and nodded.
“It’s wonderful!” Carolyn exclaimed.
“And useful,” Kamery mused, her gaze turned in the direction of the shipwreck, now hidden behind the Defias-occupied island just south of them.
Reminded of their purpose, and peril, the three women crouched lower in the water.
“Do you know this Renn?” Bryna asked, as they waded, then swam, offshore, following the sea lion.
“No, I’ve never heard of him,” Kamery responded. “That’s nothing new for SI:7 though.”
Elthas seemed to know where to go, and in short order, they reached a low, rocky outcropping, behind which floated a Human in a diving helmet.
The diver looked them over through the thick glass front of his helmet. Seemingly satisfied with the lack of red bandannas or aggression, he turned his attention to Kamery. “Well met, rogue. What brings you out here?” His voice echoed oddly from within the brass helmet.
Wondering why he kept the thing on, since he wasn’t actually diving, Carolyn rested her feet against the steep underwater drop-off of the nearby rock, grateful for the support. While she could swim fairly effectively in her robes, they did tend to tangle about her legs sometimes, making it an exhausting undertaking. The silk of her new attire had been refreshingly light compared to the old wool, and she cast a grateful glance Bryna’s way, although she wasn’t sure if the mage noticed.
Kamery showed Renn the letter that Elthas had found, and the diver nodded. “That explains why they’ve been searching the wreckage. We have to locate this valuable cargo before the Defias recover it! They’re no divers, but my gear is busted.” His gloved hand indicated a valve at the base of his helmet.
Smiling as Elthas’s sleek form slid past her legs, Carolyn told Renn, “We have our own diver.”
He noticed Elthas then, his eyes widening inside his helmet. Carolyn found herself even more mystified and bemused by the continued use of the accessory.
Renn addressed Elthas directly, “There’s plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz.” A wave of his hand along the surface of the water indicated a large island rising steeply out of the water to the southeast. “The Defias have already got divers out there, but they’re not going right to the bottom yet. They’re not very good,” he decreed once again.
Elthas’s sea lion nodded again, twisting to dive in the indicated direction.
Urgency colored Renn’s voice, as he warned, “Don’t go too close to Alcaz! Those hydra are fierce.”
A flick of his tail indicated Elthas’s receipt of the warning, and he disappeared deeper into the murky waters. They had fought hydra on the western coast of Kalimdor too, in Ashenvale, and Carolyn shuddered at the memory of the searing bite of their poisonous spit. The multi-headed creatures could be vicious, and the looming presence of the foreboding island only heightened the sense of danger. She hoped her friend would find what they needed before venturing too close. His eagerness to fulfill a quest could sometimes get the better of his common sense.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Onyxia is engaged
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Standing at the entrance to Onyxia’s cavern, Carolyn paused to cast a fortification spell on her allies. She felt Elthas’s magic mingling with hers, bolstering them all. Jaina also cast a quick spell, and Carolyn felt her mind expand, increasing the power of her spells.
The brood-mother was sleeping, yet unaware of their presence. At the edges of the room, masses of spike-covered black eggs pulsed, reminding Carolyn of the similar clutches in Blackrock Spire. Remembering Vaelan’s warning, she wished that he had been able to join them, but the red dragon had been drained by his efforts in the Spire, and he had left them, to return to his own kind.
Pointing out the eggs, she implored her allies to stay clear. The brood-mother would be enough on her own; they did not need to be swarmed by angry whelplings also.
Raynn nodded her acknowledgment, but her attention never left the sleeping dragon.
“Ready?” Varian’s voice was low to not disturb the dragon; it was the well-modulated voice of a King, but now carried a hint of the rough impatience that Carolyn had come to know. He was waiting on their agreement though, and seemed content to allow Raynn to lead the battle.
The King’s piercing blue eyes were on her now, breaking her out of her reverie, and she nodded. At Varian’s signal, Raynn charged in, waking the dragon with a blow from her shield. Her momentum carrying her forward, the warrior circled around at the back of the cavern. The maneuver left Onyxia’s flanks exposed to the blades of the others.
The tactic had been discussed as they had planned back in Theramore; while they hadn’t been sure of the exact layout of the lair, they had all agreed that turning the dragon herself would be more efficient than the entire group having to circle around her sweeping tail.
Well-prepared, Carolyn ran behind Raynn, wrapping the warrior in a golden shield as she went. Veering to one side of the dragon’s bulk, she halted within range of the entire group.</Text>

            <Title>25-03-19-L18-Raynn -To Ironforge</Title>
            <Text>Certainly! Here's a continuation of Raynn's story:

After reporting her findings to Anduin, Lady Prestor, and Bolvar Fordragon in the throne room of Stormwind Keep, Raynn felt a mix of annoyance and determination. Lady Prestor's dismissive attitude only fueled her desire to prove herself further. It was during these times that Raynn learned to use that frustration as fuel for her determination.

With new tasks at hand, Raynn sought to further hone her blacksmithing skills. She met with Dane Lindgren, an outdoor forge expert in the Dwarven District. Under his guidance, she crafted powerful weapons and armor, becoming a skilled blacksmith in Stormwind.

However, her thirst for knowledge and improvement didn't end there. Dane, recognizing Raynn's potential, suggested that she journey to Ironforge. There, she could learn from the master blacksmiths Grumnus Steelshaper and Ironus Coldsteel at the Great Forge.

Raynn wasted no time. Taking the Deeprun Tram from Stormwind to Ironforge, she marveled at the familiar yet distinct surroundings of the Dwarven capital. The Great Forge, a testament to Dwarven craftsmanship, awaited her.

As Raynn entered Ironforge, she felt a sense of nostalgia from her childhood among the Dwarves in the Wetlands and Hinterlands. The clanging of hammers, the heat of the forge, and the rich aroma of molten metal welcomed her. It was time for a new chapter in her journey, one that would unfold amidst the roaring flames of Ironforge's Great Forge.

---

In the grand throne room of Stormwind Keep, Raynn found herself standing before a young Anduin Wrynn, the heir to the throne. Lady Katrana Prestor, a noblewoman with an air of disdain, observed the proceedings with an imperious gaze. Beside her, Bolvar Fordragon, the stalwart paladin, exuded a sense of silent vigilance.

Anduin: &quot;Raynn, I'm pleased you've returned. Your reports have been crucial.&quot;

Raynn offered a respectful nod, her attention momentarily caught by Lady Prestor's haughty demeanor. The noblewoman seemed unimpressed, her gaze fixed on Raynn with an air of condescension.

Prestor: &quot;Your service is duly noted. Now, if you'll excuse us, Anduin, we have matters to discuss.&quot;

Raynn maintained her composure, responding with a courteous bow as she exited the throne room. Though inwardly annoyed by Prestor's dismissive attitude, she knew the politics of nobility well enough to keep her thoughts to herself.

With her official duties concluded, Raynn sought out her blacksmithing instructor, Dane Lindgren, in the Dwarven District. The clang of metal on metal guided her to the outdoor forge, where the skilled blacksmith awaited.

Instructor Lindgren: &quot;Raynn, you've come far in your training. You've learned what I can teach you here.&quot;

Raynn acknowledged the compliment, appreciating the guidance she had received. Lindgren's suggestion intrigued her.

Instructor Lindgren: &quot;To further hone your skills, I recommend a journey to Ironforge. The Dwarven blacksmiths there are unmatched, and you'll find an environment that complements your talents.&quot;

Raynn nodded, grateful for the advice. She made her way to the Deeprun Tram, an underground marvel that connected Stormwind to Ironforge. The rhythmic clattering of the tram echoed her anticipation.

Arriving in Ironforge, Raynn marveled at the grandeur of the Great Forge. Here, she sought out the master blacksmiths Grumnus Steelshaper and Ironus Coldsteel, eager to immerse herself in the legendary craftsmanship of the Dwarves.

As Raynn delved into the artistry of Ironforge, she couldn't have foreseen the profound impact this journey would have on her skills and the connections she would forge within the heart of Dwarven culture. Little did she know that these experiences would weave into the larger tapestry of Azeroth's unfolding stories.

            <Synopsis>- Bryna learns to teleport to Theramore
- Studies with Jaina Proudmoore</Synopsis>
            <Text>Bryna lowered her arm when Kamery spotted her. Thank goodness for the observant rogue. She had been on the verge of taking off her hat to wave it, and then she would have had to tuck her shoulder-length hair back up under it again.
The mage could smell the smoke in the air from the forges and smelters of the Dwarven District, and suspected that the druid beside her had lost the scent. It was a good thing Kamery and Carolyn had come out when they had. Bryna briefly wondered what business they had had in the Keep. So soon after our last ‘business’ there too.
Kamery led the sisters over, and Elthas shifted out of form. He had seemed even more energetic than usual, and she suspected it had something to do with his upcoming trip to Darnassus. ‘Training,” he had said. She wondered what he would be learning. Wondered if maybe she should venture up to the top of the tower herself soon, to see if there was anything new she could learn. She suspected there would be; she had been away too long.
“What brings you two here?” Carolyn asked. She had a hand in one of the pockets of her robe, and fidgeted nervously, until Kamery gave her a discreet nudge with her elbow. Curious, Bryna thought, watching them from under the brim of her hat.
Elthas’s exuberance seemed to deflate a little at the thought of saying goodbye. “I have to return to Darnassus for training.” He looked apologetic.
Bryna wasn’t sure, but she thought that Carolyn actually relaxed a little at that, although the priestess’s outward reaction was directed at Elthas.
Carolyn smiled happily at the druid, as she told him, “I just learned a new spell myself. I can’t wait to see what you learn!”
Elthas grinned happily and nodded enthusiastically. “I’ll come back as soon as I can!” He glanced over his shoulder at the hazy Dwarven District. “I want to say goodbye to Raynn too.”
The druid remained in his Kaldorei form as they entered the District. Her nose wrinkling at the pervasive smoke, Bryna couldn’t blame him. An old memory flashed in her mind as a pair of Gnomes scurried past them, animatedly arguing about their latest engineering creation. She had once pictured the tall Kaldorei amongst the much shorter Gnomes, and the sight lived up to her imagination.
In the center of the District, the forges and anvils were busy, with blacksmiths and engineers both hammering away at the various bits and pieces for their trades. Their work filled the air with rhythmic clangs and bangs, accompanied by the sizzle of hot metal meeting cooling water. The red brick of the plaza was stained with soot.
To one side, Raynn stood, her face covered with a sheen of sweat, and strands of her auburn hair stuck to her cheeks. Her arm flexed, showing off her lean muscles as she swung the heavy hammer, pounding away at a large piece of iron. She noticed them approach, and her movements slowed momentarily. She frowned briefly at the piece of metal.
“Hi,” she greeted them shortly, between swings. “It’s hot.” Another swing of the hammer. “Wait a moment?”
Nodding, they moved to one side, watching as the warrior-smith worked. Her movements were tight and controlled, much like her fighting. A few minutes later, she was either satisfied with the shape of the metal, or it had cooled too much to keep working. Setting it aside, Raynn came over to them.
“New breastplate?” Bryna guessed.
Raynn nodded, her eyes reflecting appreciation for the mage’s observance.
“What brings you all here?” she asked. “Not another Defias plot?”
Out of the corner of her eye, Bryna saw Carolyn flinch, but nobody else seemed to notice.
“I’m heading back to Darnassus,” Elthas answered. “I wanted to say goodbye.”
Raynn nodded, her eyes unreadable. “I may be leaving soon myself,” she told them. With a gesture at the nearly finished breastplate behind her, she explained, “Two more pieces, and I can return to the Grand Masters in Ironforge.” There was quiet pride in her voice.
“That’s wonderful!” Carolyn exclaimed. “I’ll miss you all though.”
Looking over the group, Bryna saw the same thing that she had when they had first assembled. They were greater than the sum of each part. “We’ll find each other again,” she proclaimed.
Carolyn and Elthas nodded immediately, with Kamery joining in after a moment. Raynn took a little longer, but eventually she also nodded. Impulsively, Carolyn stretched her arms out to embrace the others. Elthas joined the gesture from the other side, his long arms engulfing them, and the five stood a moment in silent farewell.
Sensing the warrior’s growing discomfort, Bryna broke the embrace, turning to Elthas to ask, “Darnassus now?”
The tall Kaldorei nodded, his golden eyes flaring with excitement. Once again, Bryna wondered what new spell had him so excited. She gathered the arcane energies, and a few moments later, the shimmering portal floated into existence, the pink and purple foliage of Teldrassil visible in its center. Elthas shifted to feline form once more, and gracefully leaped through the portal.
“We have some business to attend to ourselves,” Kamery made their excuses, indicating herself and Carolyn.
Catching Raynn’s longing look back at the forge, Bryna made it quick, adding, “I should get back to the Tower too. I’ll see you all later!”
She pulled the arcane energies again, noting at the back of her mind how silly it was to teleport across the city, but also admitting that she didn’t like walking up the ramp to the tower. The lack of railing was disconcerting. As the teleport spell surrounded her in whirling sensations and colors, she saw the twin sisters head back the way they had come, while Raynn returned to her forge.
As the dizzying sensations faded, Bryna blinked in the sudden dimness of the cool interior of the Tower. The acrid smells of smoke and molten metal were replaced by the dusty scent of ancient parchment and ink. She wrinkled her nose, reminding herself that she was here to find new spells to learn.
Perusing the shelves, she found herself drawn to her favorite tome, ‘Teleportation in Azeroth’. She already knew the basic spells, but there had been a few others that she hadn’t been able to decipher the last time she had looked at them. Pulling the slim book down, she curled up in a nearby chair and flipped it open.
The first few spells were familiar, and she quickly leafed past those. Beyond though, was an intriguing one: Teleport: Theramore. Scanning the spell, Bryna realized that she could indeed learn this one now. She re-read the note neatly penned in the margin of the book, already familiar from previous attempts to read this spell. ‘Home to Lady Jaina Proudmoore, Arch-mage of the Kirin Tor.’
Tracing her finger over those words, Bryna felt a thrill run through her. How much could she learn from Lady Proudmoore?!
Quickly committing the spell to heart, Bryna put the book back in its place on the shelf, and began pulling the arcane threads around herself again.</Text>

            <Text>The Hillsbrad Foothills stretched beneath Raynn's gryphon as she patrolled the skies for the Wildhammer dwarves. The distant sound of crashing waves from Southshore caught her attention, and as she descended for a closer look, the scene unfolded before her eyes.

Orcs hurriedly boarded ships along the Southshore coastline, preparing for a departure that seemed urgent. Simultaneously, a human army marched purposefully from Durnholde Keep to the northeast, closing in on the orcs' position.

Raynn swiftly landed her gryphon in a secluded grove, concealing the majestic creature among the trees. Dressed in dusty riding leathers, she descended the hills to approach the human army. Mixing seamlessly with the locals, she sought to divert their attention and misdirect their efforts.

Approaching the human commander with a demeanor of concern, Raynn spoke of orcs seen marching to the north, hinting at a potential alliance with the already-suspected nobles of Alterac. Her words were laced with truthful anger as she declared, &quot;An orc killed my father. I will not stand idly by while they plot in the shadows.&quot;

The commander, swayed by her convincing performance and the supposed threat to the north, altered the army's course accordingly. Unbeknownst to Raynn, Thrall, the young orc Warchief, observed this misdirection through farsight – a magical ability that allowed him to witness events from a distance.

Recognizing Raynn and sensing a connection that transcended the immediate situation, Thrall's protectiveness flared. He immediately sought out Grom Hellscream, a seasoned warrior and ally, to share what he had witnessed.

Grom, renowned for his ferocity in battle, insisted on bringing Raynn with them to Kalimdor, removing her from the potential danger of retaliation once the truth of her misdirection came to light. Thrall, though reluctant due to the unknown dangers that awaited them on the journey, couldn't deny the sense of responsibility and connection he felt toward Raynn.

Together, Thrall and Grom rode out to retrieve Raynn from her position near the human army. The trio would soon embark on a journey to Kalimdor, where the threads of fate would weave their destinies together in unforeseen ways.</Text>

            <Text>Gideon's fingers danced across the gears, his eyes narrowing in focused concentration. Evelyn, equally engrossed, adjusted her spectacles as they collectively unraveled the mystery of the malfunctioning portal device. The rhythmic clinks and hums of the workshop echoed their determination.

Anduin and Lily, caught in a quiet conversation, seemed momentarily forgotten. Gideon spared them an occasional glance, reassured by the camaraderie developing in his workspace. The spark of connection between the two worlds, not just mechanical but personal, fueled the fervor in his work.

&quot;Ah, there it is,&quot; Gideon exclaimed, a triumphant grin spreading across his face as he adjusted a crucial component.

Evelyn, her eyes bright with excitement, nodded in agreement. &quot;That should do it. The portal should stabilize now.&quot;

Anduin and Lily, sensing a shift in the workshop's energy, turned their attention to the inventors.

Gideon gestured towards the revitalized device, pride evident in his voice. &quot;Our makeshift portal should transport you back to Azeroth without a hitch now. It's been a pleasure to work on such a unique project.&quot;

Anduin extended his gratitude, a genuine smile crossing his features. &quot;You've given us hope, Gideon. We won't forget this.&quot;

As the group gathered around the humming portal, the air thick with anticipation, Gideon marveled at the unforeseen bonds forged in the pursuit of knowledge. In this shared endeavor, he found not only the joy of invention but also the profound satisfaction of bringing worlds together. The workshop, a testament to the collaborative spirit, echoed with the promise of new beginnings and the enduring magic of unexpected connections.</Text>

- Messenger arrives with a note
- Shaw tells Kam to spend some time with her sister</Synopsis>
            <Text>Meanwhile in Mathias Shaw’s office in the SI:7 headquarters, Kamery was finishing up her report of their recent activities.
“Good work,” Shaw nodded at Kamery. “Swift justice. You have done the people of Stormwind a great service, whether they know it or not.” He paused for a moment, looking out the window thoughtfully. His office, on the upper floor of the SI:7 headquarters, offered a commanding view over the city, sprawling beyond the lawn separating SI:7 from the warriors’ barracks.
Kamery waited quietly, wondering if she had been dismissed or not. It was hard to tell with Shaw sometimes. A lot of things were hard to tell with Shaw. The man was a master of his craft, which of course, was why she was here. She studied the room carefully, although she had been here many times already; one never knew when something would change.
The walls and floor were solid oak planks, plain and unadorned. A sturdy desk stood opposite the window, its surface covered with papers—nothing important, Kamery knew. The important papers would be in the locked drawers. The most important information was stored only in Shaw’s mind. Behind her, she knew, the staircase to the lower floors curved downwards in a spiral that followed the shape of the tower. There was no railing—rogues were meant to be careful, and agile.
“Did you report this to anyone else?” Shaw turned back to her.
Kamery hesitated, knowing that he noticed, then answered honestly, “Trias gave us a report for the King.” She tried to keep her voice steady, knowing that Shaw often dealt with the aristocracy. Growing up in Elwynn Forest, she had been regaled with stories of the noble King Varian, who had reclaimed and rebuilt Stormwind just before she and Carolyn had been born. Steadying herself, she continued, “Raynn took it to the Keep.”
Shaw was silent for a moment, and, studying him, Kamery noticed that he had stilled, his jaw tight. He seemed to collect himself though, raising his eyebrows as he asked, “Raynn?”
Kamery nodded, remembering the warrior’s nonchalance. “She volunteered.” Although, it may just have been to avoid coming back here, she added mentally.
A faint smile appeared on Shaw’s face as he added the extra piece to his mental profile of the warrior. Raynn intrigued him, Kamery knew, and like a dog with a bone, he wouldn’t give up until he had figured her out. The spy-master nodded, as if that piece fit nicely. Kamery wondered what the two of them had spoken about earlier, when he had not-so-subtly dismissed her to leave him alone with the warrior.
Wondering if her next piece of the puzzle would surprise Shaw, Kamery told him, “Elthas says she”—she tried to remember the druid’s wording—“‘feels like Kalimdor.’”
Shaw only nodded thoughtfully though, leaving Kamery feeling slightly disappointed, and wondering if perhaps she should have kept that tidbit to herself. She was certain that Shaw had not shared all of his knowledge with her.
Reminding her that nothing stayed hidden from Mathias Shaw for long, he changed the subject abruptly, telling her, “Stoutmantle sends word that Defias activity has slowed in Westfall. He says Loran is settling in well in Sentinel Hill.” A faint smirk turned his lips now.
Kamery stiffened at the mention of the Defias messenger boy. Knowing that her spontaneous act of mercy towards the boy could be seen as a weakness, she hadn’t told Shaw about Loran.
Shaw assuaged her fears though, stepping closer to lay a hand on her shoulder. “You have a good heart.”
He seemed about to continue, but footsteps on the stairs below alerted them to a visitor. The footsteps were awkwardly loud and deliberate. Nobody in this building made any sound when they moved, but nobody in this building would dare sneak up on Shaw either.
A moment later, the young messenger came into sight, his steps quieting when he saw that he had their attention. He was just a young boy, one of the many that Shaw had watching the city for him. Tousled brown hair topped a smudged face and threadbare clothes. His eyes were bright and alert though, and his lean body stood straight as he handed Shaw a folded piece of paper.
Once again, Kamery wondered if she should leave, but Shaw signaled her to wait with a gesture as he flipped the note open and scanned its contents.
“Thank you. Well done.” Shaw handed the messenger a silver coin, and shooed the boy back down the stairs. The coin disappeared quickly into his shirt, and the messenger left.
“Kamery,” Shaw addressed her with an unreadable look and she felt her heart sink. Another assignment then. She had hoped for a reprieve, a chance to spend some time with Carolyn, and her new friends. “Go spend some time with your sister.”
Kamery couldn’t hide her surprise, and Shaw chuckled briefly, before he warned, “It may not be as relaxing as you think.” With a wave, he dismissed her, walking over towards his desk.
Nodding, Kamery turned and left. The warning left her curious, but she wondered, How much trouble could a priestess get into? Then again, I still don’t know everything that happened in Kalimdor…</Text>

            <Title>The Great Forge</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Raynn completes her iron plate armor
- Dane sends Raynn to Grumnus Steelshaper at the Great Forge
- Grumnus tells her about the Mithril Order
- Sends Raynn to Galvan the Ancient in Stranglethorn Vale</Synopsis>
            <Text>Several days later, back in Stormwind, Raynn faced a journey of her own. She stood straight and tall on the platform waiting for the Deeprun Tram, proud in her newly completed set of iron plate armor. The pieces fit her well, and she was glad to not have to continually adjust them. She was ready to show the set to the master smiths of Ironforge and receive their judgment on her skill.
The first step of that journey approached now, with a mechanical rattle growing nearer in the tunnel to her left. Looking down the wide sloping passageway, she could see the open cars of the Tram rattle upwards, slowing as they approached the Stormwind platform.
Marveling at the Gnomish engineering, she stepped onto the closest car as it shuddered to a stop. The automated system would wait for a few moments for people to disembark and embark, then it would rattle off back to Ironforge again. She knew there was a twin train running on the parallel track beyond this one, that would probably be waiting in Ironforge right now.
With a shudder, the car began moving, picking up speed as it rolled down the slope that would bring it down to the floor of the sea that lay between the two cities. Part of the tunnel roof was made of clear material, and Raynn watched the sea life lazily swimming about as the train passed. They seemed unaware of the noisy clanking that seemed to accompany all Gnomish contrivances.
The train passed into darkness again, leaving the dim glow of the water behind. Shortly, it began its slow rise up towards Ironforge. Ahead, Raynn could see the artificial lights of the station at the Dwarven end of the tram. The ride was familiar to her, as she had often preferred to travel to Dun Morogh, and even nearby Loch Modan, to do odd jobs for the locals, rather than stay in the Stormwind area.
Having grown up amongst the close-minded people of Lordaeron, she had been pleased to find that the Humans of Stormwind, her father’s people, were more open-minded. However, her father had also worked closely with the Dwarves in Khaz Modan. Later, living among them herself—in Dun Modr, then Aerie Peak, and finally Ironforge itself—she had become accustomed to their gruff ways and the heavy stone buildings that so many other Humans found oppressive. Although she didn’t live there permanently anymore, she loved Ironforge, and felt a sense of homecoming as the Tram rattled into the station.
Jumping off the Tram almost before it came to a complete stop, Raynn strode eagerly away from the platform and into the chaotic bustle of Tinkertown, the Gnomish enclave in Ironforge. Mechanical clanking and whirring surrounded her, accompanied by bright flashing lights from the various workshops. She barely flinched as something exploded off to her right, well-accustomed by now to the often volatile endeavors of the brilliant engineers.
Raynn quickly passed through the tunnel into the cavern that housed the Hall of Explorers, taking respite in the quieter atmosphere. A low murmur of voices came from within the Hall itself, somewhere beyond the massive stone pillars that flanked the entrance. Beyond, she caught a flash of white, and remembered the huge skeletons that had stood in the front hall. She had spent many days here in the past four years, reading and hearing about the history of Stormwind and its people.
The Dwarves had been proud allies during the war, until their lands had been overrun by the Orcish Horde. Raynn was proud that her father had been among those to help liberate this bustling city, only weeks after she had been born. Throughout her early life, he had done well to spend time with his young family, while still aiding the Dwarves in fully taking back their lands.
Her heart tightened as she remembered the smiling man who had first introduced her to the forge, when she had only been six years old, against her mother’s laughing protests. She hoped that he would have been proud of how far she had come, of what she had accomplished. She was here today for the culmination of that work, not to reminisce; those happy early days had been over too soon. Resolutely, Raynn pushed the bittersweet memories away and focused on the present.
Her step quickened, as she turned away from the great library, and made her way down a passageway that passed several Dwarven homes built into the rock of the underground city; the cozy homes were carved with intricate details, showcasing the craftsmanship of the Dwarves. The familiar smell of molten metal and stone washed over her as she emerged to the sight of the Great Forge. The entire city of Ironforge was built in a circle around the Forge and its massive cavern.
The connecting passage led into the wide walkway that ringed the cavern, curving to either side around the lake of magma bubbling far beneath. Waves of heat made the air shimmer as they rose upwards, and Raynn felt perspiration break out on her forehead. The magma ran under the entire city, keeping it warm despite its location high in the snowy mountains. A sturdy stone wall lined the open pit, preventing accidents, and overhead, a large crucible slowly dripped molten rock down past the Forge, which was on a wide bridge that spanned the circular pit directly ahead of her.
Raynn crossed the outer walkway swiftly, briefly looking beyond the Forge to the entrance to Magni’s chambers. The solid double doors stood open, welcoming. She smiled, remembering the Dwarven King’s friendliness and straightforwardness. They stood in stark contrast to the unpleasant attitudes of the Nobles of Stormwind. Running her thumb over her left fingers, where she wore the young King’s signet under her gauntlet, she reflected that at least the royalty of Stormwind hadn’t been so bad.
As she reached the great anvil that marked the very center of the city, a gruff Dwarven voice broke her reverie. “Lass!” She looked down to see the master armor-smith of Ironforge, Grumnus Steelshaper. He was approaching her, a look of approval on his face. “You’ve finished the set, I see. Let me look.”
Raynn paused at the gruff command. She was proud of her work, and felt that she had done well, but now, under the master smith’s eye, she felt uncertainty. Grumnus walked around her, examining the details of her armor. At his imperious gesture, she pulled off her right gauntlet and handed it to him, so he might look closer.
Finally, Grumnus stepped back, satisfied. “Excellent work!” he complimented her, and Raynn relaxed as she slipped the returned gauntlet back on her hand.
“You’ve done well,” Grumnus continued, “and learned everything we have to teach you here. Remember, lass, blacksmithing doesn’t come from here.” He held up his hammer. “It doesn’t come from there.” He pointed over at the Great Anvil. “It comes from here.” Emphatically, the Dwarf placed his hand over his heart.
As Raynn absorbed his words, he looked at her intently, as he told her, “It’s time for your next steps. Are you up for a journey?”
Raynn couldn’t suppress her smile as she eagerly agreed, curious as to where this would take her.
“When I was about your age,” Grumnus reminisced, “a Dwarf by the name of Galvan took me under his wing and trained me in the ways of the armor-smith. He departed for Booty Bay years ago, leaving me to train those who would follow.”
Grumnus held out a smooth, round insignia, made of some metal that Raynn didn’t recognize. She took it, examining it curiously.
“It’s mithril,” the master smith revealed. “The insignia of the Mithril Order, the finest armor-smiths on Azeroth. Although Galvan has since left Booty Bay, members of the Order remain there, hoping to find others worthy of his tutelage. Take the insignia to McGavan in Booty Bay, and he will see that you are worthy.”
Awed, Raynn nodded silently. She had heard of Booty Bay, on the far southern tip of the continent, in the wilds of Stranglethorn Vale. It would be a long, dangerous trip, but for the chance to learn from a master of the Mithril Order, she would make it.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Elthas encourages Raynn to stop burying her memories</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn nodded, making an obvious effort to still her hand by resting it on her upraised knees with the other. “Long since healed,” she addressed Carolyn’s concerned look. Her eyes were distant with memory, avoiding their gazes and her face was closing up again in that familiar way. She couldn’t keep doing this, Elthas decided. Reaching out, he took Raynn’s hands in his, holding on as she tried to pull back.
“Memories are wounds too,” he told her. “If not treated, they fester and putrefy. Wounds need to be cleansed; memories too need purging. Perhaps not with us, but you need to share with someone, not just continue to bandage over them.”
Raynn stopped resisting as he spoke, and she seemed to be considering his words. He and the other Humans waited in comforting silence, broken only by the buzzing of the night insects, giving her the time she needed.</Text>

            <Title>Age Dynamics</Title>
            <Text>The dynamics between characters of different ages can be rich and varied, offering opportunities for growth, mentorship, and diverse perspectives within your narrative. Here are some potential dynamics based on the age differences you've described:
1. **Leadership Roles:**
   - The main characters who have taken on leadership roles at a young age may find themselves challenged or enriched by interacting with older characters who have more experience. They may learn valuable leadership lessons or gain insights into decision-making from those with more life experience.
2. **Mentorship:**
   - Older characters may take on mentorship roles, guiding the younger characters in various aspects of life, whether it's combat, wisdom, or navigating complex situations.
3. **Cultural Differences:**
   - Characters from different races and backgrounds may bring unique perspectives and cultural nuances to the group. This can lead to interesting discussions, misunderstandings, or moments of cultural exchange.
4. **Conflict and Resolution:**
   - Age differences can sometimes lead to conflicts, especially if younger characters feel underestimated or if older characters struggle with adapting to the viewpoints of the younger generation. These conflicts can offer opportunities for character development and resolution.
5. **Shared Experiences:**
   - Despite the age differences, shared experiences, challenges, and victories can create strong bonds among characters. Finding common ground can bridge the gap between generations.
6. **Individual Growth:**
   - Each character, regardless of age, can undergo personal growth and development. Younger characters may mature and gain wisdom through their experiences, while older characters might find renewed purpose or fresh perspectives.
Consider exploring these dynamics through character interactions, dialogue, and shared experiences. This can add depth and authenticity to your narrative as characters navigate the complexities of their relationships across age differences.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Varian/Lo'Gosh, Broll, Kamery, Raynn, Carolyn, Elthas, Bryna travel to Blackrock Mountain</Synopsis>
            <Text>After Varian’s grudging acceptance of their aid, the path ahead seemed clearer. With their course agreed upon, the group settled down for the night in Morgan’s Vigil, laying their bedrolls on the ground behind the burnt-out houses. By unspoken consent, they stayed well away from Ragged John’s barrel, where the Dwarf was now passed out, snoring loudly.
Elthas and Broll prepared dinner, talking in hushed tones, while Carolyn, under Bryna’s watchful eye, mended her robe. The mage was pleased to note that the priestess worked with quiet competence, and her repair work, enhanced by enchantment, was all but invisible now.
Raynn and Varian sparred with each other to one side, the clashes of their weapons punctuating the still night in a mounting crescendo. Glancing over, Bryna noted that the two seemed to be well-matched, and neither appeared willing to concede. She wondered if Carolyn’s healing would be needed before the two were finished.
Broll, thankfully, provided an interruption to the two warriors, informing them that dinner was ready, and the group settled in for a meal of roasted drake meat, seasoned with the sungrass that Kamery had somehow managed to find growing in the blasted land.
The rogue had spent the evening quietly preparing more potions, and now she distributed them to the group. Bryna gratefully tucked the mana and spell-power potions in her belt pouch.
After dinner, they discussed the upcoming dangers, trying to piece together what Varian had learned from Ragged John. Apparently, Windsor had fought off a force of Blackrock Orcs just within the mountain, but had then been captured by a larger force of Dark Iron Dwarves. The possibility of encountering either group loomed large, as they settled in for the night’s rest.</Text>

            <Title>Group Summons to CoT</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bronze Dragonflight summons Bryna back, telling her to bring friends</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn watched the strange boy turn away from Bryna and leave the town. Kamery wasn’t the only one who could be curious, she realized with amusement. The mage stood still for a moment, an odd look on her face. She still hadn’t come to greet Kamery yet, or to see Raynn’s now-finished breastplate.
Pride swelled in Raynn as she glanced over at the piece, resting on a bench near Trenton’s small workshop. The metal would be cooled now; it was almost ready to wear. The rest of the set waited in her bag now, with the exception of the boots that she was wearing. She had bought a pair of leather leggings on her first day here, when she had realized how hot it was working at a forge in the middle of a desert.
Trenton had said it built character, but she knew by now that he only stayed here because of his obsession with Zul’Farrak. He was a brilliant blacksmith though, and had been a good tutor. Although he had acted annoyed, she knew that he had been pleased when her friends had arrived, since it had given him a captive audience for his tales of cursed swords in the Troll ruins.
Carolyn was apologetically telling Trenton of their failure to find the sword now though, while Elthas prowled behind her and Kamery, giving the platinum-haired Kaldorei the occasional considering glance. Raynn wondered what the druid was thinking, then silently laughed at herself. Either Kamery was contagious, or it was simply that Kamery was more outspoken in her curiosity.
The rogue stood next to her sister now, listening to Carolyn’s tales of undead Trolls with amusement.
“They just wouldn’t stay dead!” The priestess exclaimed in annoyance.
Bryna was approaching now, and she laughed at Carolyn’s words, but her face was oddly pensive.
“How close are you to finishing your armor?” The mage asked Raynn. Her expression and tone told the warrior that it wasn’t just an idle query.
Raynn gestured to the finished breastplate, pride mixing with growing eagerness. It had been far too long since she had been in meaningful combat, and with her blacksmithing journey complete, she was ready for the return. “It’s done,” she told the mage, glad to see Bryna’s face light up with genuine happiness for her.
“That’s wonderful!” Carolyn exclaimed. She hadn’t noticed either, Raynn realized. Only Kamery had been here to see the final details added, and to hear Trenton’s praise. She had been working on a practice piece when they had arrived.
Raynn smiled her gratitude to the priestess, but turned back to Bryna. “Will I need it?”
Bryna nodded, looking around the now-complete group. “Something has come up that needs all of us.” Her gaze was a question, and with quick glances between them, they all nodded. “I can explain on the way.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Riding through Wyrmbog towards Onyxia's lair
- Raynn has a new kitty cat</Synopsis>
            <Text>Guiding her frostsaber through the hills and into the bog, Raynn thought back to how she had met the sleek, powerful mount.
After Haleh had told them that they needed the blood of a champion of the Black Dragonflight, Raynn, Kamery, and Bryna had descended the snow-covered mountainside and returned to the main road of Winterspring. There had been no sign of Carolyn or Elthas, so they had ridden up the northern road that the two had taken.
At the end of the road, a large rock had risen up out of an icy-covered lake. The air was crisp and clean, a stark contrast to the smoky environs of Blackrock Mountain, with snow drifting lazily on the light breeze. Several massive grey and white striped cats had been playing with Carolyn’s moonsaber, leaping and pouncing in the snow. Despite their size, the cats’ grace and agility made their play near-soundless.
Their horses had been skittish, so they had dismounted as they approached closer. The large cats had noticed, padding over to investigate the newcomers, with Elthas in their midst. The druid seemed to have some sort of understanding with the wild creatures, and they sniffed around curiously, but not threateningly.
Raynn had been surprised when one of the cats had nudged her with its large muzzle. The cat had risen up on its hindquarters to place its massive paws on her shoulders. Its rough whiskers had tickled her face, eliciting a laugh.
The frostsaber had nuzzled her face, then licked it with a moist, rough tongue. When it returned to four paws, it stayed at her side. Understanding why Carolyn had wanted a moonsaber, Raynn had taken off her gauntlet to scratch the cat behind the ears, enjoying the feel of its silky fur. She reveled in the immediacy of the moment and the unquestioning acceptance of the frostsaber, letting the pain of her past fade away for a time.
They had played with the cats for a little while longer, taking a brief respite from worrying about the Black Dragonflight. When responsibility set in again, Elthas had interpreted for the frostsaber—it was curious and wanted to join them; it would be happy to serve as Raynn’s mount.
Over the next few days, Elthas had used his leather-working skills to fashion a light saddle and harness for them, and now, the cat eagerly carried her through the Wyrmbog to Onyxia’s lair. The growing smoke in the air was a stark contrast to where they had met, and Raynn stroked the cat’s neck in appreciation.</Text>

            <Title>Now What, Take 2</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Everyone returns to Stormwind with the same message: Ask Haleh.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Much later, the five adventurers found themselves gathered together in Mathias Shaw’s office overlooking Stormwind. Kamery stood quietly next to Shaw, her eyes taking in the assembled group.
On the other side of Shaw, Carolyn was smiling peacefully. The rogue was glad that her sister had stayed with her, rather than returning to her adventures in Kalimdor with Elthas. It was wonderful to be able to work together so often now, and Carolyn’s healing was a huge boost to the group. Pride flowed through Kamery at how far her sister had progressed in her priestly studies.
The usual recipient of Caro’s healing stood next to her, as if using the priestess as a shield to separate herself from Shaw. Kamery noted that Raynn also stood closest to the stairs. Was that on purpose? The warrior’s confidence showed in her pose, straight and tall, although perhaps a bit rigid now—she was still uncomfortable around the perceptive master of SI:7. I’m glad she told us her past; she’s a friend now, not just an ally. Perhaps someday, she’ll trust Shaw too. In the meantime, I won’t betray that trust.
Beside Raynn, Bryna was a contrast in attitudes. Her posture was relaxed and easy, the brim of her bright red hat shielding her eyes. Eyes that, Kamery had realized, didn’t miss much. Bryna could easily have trained for SI:7 herself, if she hadn’t been so magically gifted.
Behind her, Kamery could feel Elthas’s constant movement, pausing only at the occasional silent reprimand from Shaw. He’s getting too close to that desk, not that there’s anything to hide on there. Kamery felt her lips curve against her black bandanna as she thought about the exuberant druid’s antics. He probably feels cooped up in this room.
“So, both Dragonflights agree, the Matron Protectorate of the Blue Dragonflight is the one to consult for magical artifacts?” Shaw confirmed their reports, looking from Elthas to Bryna. “And you know where to find her?”
Bryna nodded for the group. While the mage had broached their request with Soridormi, Andormu had approached Kamery, Carolyn, and Raynn, asking for their assistance in another time-way. After spending hours fighting feral Worgen and mindless Scourge in a distant keep, they had returned to find Bryna and Soridormi still deep in conversation. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that. Hours passed for us, but it was probably only a few minutes for them. At least they wrapped up quickly when we got back.
When she had noticed their return, Bryna had come over to relay the good and bad news—the Bronze Dragonflight was unable to help, but she knew where to find one who might.
Elthas had returned with similar news, not long afterwards. The Green Dragonflight had likewise been unable to provide answers, but had recommended the Blue Dragons as the masters of all things arcane. Broll had decided to remain in the Moonglade a while longer, while Elthas had returned with the information.
Absorbing their reports, Shaw wasted no time dispatching them once more, this time to Winterspring. Although he kept his face impassive, Kamery knew that the ever-inquisitive spy-master was disappointed that the urgency of the matter precluded a longer report on their past few months.
With their destination clear, Bryna sped them on their way with a portal to Darnassus, and they flew from there to the Goblin-run town of Everlook, in central Winterspring.</Text>

            <Text>The battle against Onyxia marked a significant turning point for Raynn, where the fusion of her diverse combat styles began to take root. The untamed power she tapped into, driven by rage and fueled by memories of loss and pain, provided her with a new dimension in combat. Although it was a nascent integration, this experience set the stage for her journey toward mastering this amalgamation of styles.
As Raynn stood amidst the aftermath, victorious yet contemplative, she sensed the potential within herself. The battle had been a crucible, allowing her to blend the carefully controlled defensive style she had honed over the years with the wild, aggressive power she had learned with the orcs. This fusion, while not fully realized, opened up new possibilities for her as a warrior. It hinted at the emergence of a unique and formidable fighting style that would continue to evolve in the battles that lay ahead.</Text>

            <Title>Ghosts of the Past</Title>
            <Synopsis>- They arrive at the Summoner's Tomb
- Ghosts are initially hostile, but Raynn needs to learn to smelt dark iron
- Varian asks Carolyn to use shadow to chain (shackle) Gloom'rel
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Carolyn caught Varian’s solicitous glance, but the battle had been relatively easy on her, so she nodded. Although the elementals had been a complication, single foes were generally straightforward in terms of healing. She gave an appreciative smile to Bryna; she hadn’t realized that the mage could conjure an entire snowstorm.
“This way.” Having seen that his healer was ready, Varian wasted no time leading them onwards through the winding tunnels. Joining him at the vanguard, Raynn exchanged a few words with the King as they approached a set of closed double doors. Although the passageway had become rough-hewn stone once more after the Flamewalker’s chamber, these doors were ornately carved, surrounded by heavy, similarly-decorated posts and lintel.
As Varian paused at the entrance, group gathered around him. Carolyn found herself opposite the two warriors, with Bryna and Broll beside Varian to her right, and Kamery and Elthas between her and Raynn to the left. Uncertain if it was simply the positioning or something else, she found Varian’s eyes lingered on her as he laid out the situation ahead of them.
“Within, lie the spirits of the Summoners,” he told them. “The seven who joined Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan in summoning Ragnaros to this plane. They are bound to the will of the Elemental Lord, and hostile to intruders.” Varian’s eyes met Carolyn’s, and held them. “However, they hold the secrets to dark iron, secrets that we need if we are to fight the Firelord. We need one chained to our will.”
At his words, Carolyn felt the familiar tightness in her chest and her thoughts swirled. She felt Kamery’s hand take hers, and knew that her sister also understood what the King was asking. Similar to taking control of a living mind, chaining a soul was a powerful Shadow spell. Working with the Shadows left her drained and disquieted.
Varian’s gaze was unremitting, brooking no argument. She offered none. He was stubborn, obstinate, reckless…but still her King.
Furthermore, his reasoning was sound; she knew that Raynn had obtained some notes on working with the strange metal, but had yet to learn how to properly extract it from the raw ore. If this would further that knowledge, then she had to try. Giving Kamery’s hand a grateful and reassuring squeeze, Carolyn nodded.
With Carolyn’s agreement solidifying their plan, Varian and Raynn pushed open the double doors and the group entered the elaborate tomb, leaving the heat of the tunnel behind. Within, the floor was tiled in glazed stone, laid out in elaborate patterns. Although the air was cooler, it carried a heaviness that seemed to muffle the sound of their steps.
The oval chamber was lined with seven alcoves, each flanked by tall fluted pillars of pale brown stone. The tops of the pillars flared as they reached the smooth ceiling high overhead. Each opening containing a large carved sarcophagus. Although the Summoners bodies had been consumed by the elemental chaos that they had unleashed, their spirits were tied to the elaborate coffins and they filled the room with an ominous foreboding.
Those spirits stirred as they reached the center of the room, converging on the group with malevolent intent. Using both her eyes and her priestly insight, Carolyn scanned the seven, finding the one she judged most malleable. With a word, golden chains of holy light locked the Dark Iron soul in place.
Raynn and Broll drew the attention of the others, pulling them away from her ghostly prisoner. Keeping one eye on her holy chains, Carolyn focused on healing the warrior and ursine druid. This part, she knew, was the easy part. The chains were holy magic, but bending the soul to her will later would take all of her strength and will. Despite knowing the toll, she was confident that she would succeed; her training had been thorough.</Text>

            <Title>This is Hillsbrad</Title>
            <Text>Bryna did her best to answer their questions, as she led them to the Caverns of Time. When they arrived, Andormu answered more questions himself, as he led them to the time-way that needed their assistance.
“This”—he gestured to a narrow path winding into vaguely familiar rolling hills—“is the time-way to Hillsbrad of the past—nine years to be exact.”
A shiver of excitement ran through Bryna. Of course, this looks like the area surrounding Dalaran’s crater. Will we be going there, back before its destruction? She glanced around her companions, to see their reactions.
Carolyn and Kamery looked mildly interested, waiting to hear their exact assignment. Elthas’s head tilted in curiosity, then he began his usual pacing around the group, investigating their surroundings as they spoke. Raynn, however, had been tense since they had approached the miniature landscape; now, she appeared deep in thought.
Andormu continued, “Forces are working against the Horde Warchief, Thrall, attempting to prevent him from ever escaping Durnholde Keep.”
Raynn drew in a sharp breath at that, eliciting curious looks from Kamery and Carolyn at what, for the stoic warrior, amounted to an outburst. Elthas had also stopped his pacing, his golden eyes now fixed on Andormu. Bryna once again regretted her omission of history books from her reading material. She tried to piece together what she did know.
 To the people of Stormwind, the Orcish Horde was primarily known as a destructive force, from the early days of the Wars. But after their defeat at Blackrock Mountain, many of the Orcs had been imprisoned in Lordaeron to the north, and largely forgotten about by the rebuilding southern kingdom. We saw the remains of one of those internment camps back in the Arathi Highlands—not that far from where this time-way leads.
At some point, the Orcs had broken free. Subsequently, they had fled to Kalimdor, where they had helped defeat the Burning Legion. However, the brief history that she had skimmed in Darnassus had been fairly vague, and grudging, about the details of the Horde’s involvement.
“If Thrall never escapes, this world—as you know it—will cease to exist.” Andormu’s warning was ominous, but vague. Amidst her confusion, Bryna felt a flicker of amusement. Are bronze dragons always this melodramatic? I suppose it’s understandable, given what they deal with. But how does Thrall figure in all of this?
Bryna racked her memory for the exact details of Thrall’s involvement prior to recent events. Her previous visit to these caverns had ensured the Horde’s arrival on Azeroth. Had Thrall been among the army that came through that portal? Jaina seemed to believe he and King Varian could negotiate peace, so it doesn’t seem likely. Had he been at the battle against the Legion? When did he emerge as Warchief anyway? I really do need to read more history books—soon.
It seemed that at least two of her companions knew more though. Raynn and Elthas were both nodding their heartfelt agreements with Andormu’s statement. A glance at Kamery and Carolyn told Bryna that the twin sisters were even more mystified than she was.
Raynn had already started forward though, as Andormu directed them into the blueish mist of the time-way, telling them to find the bronze dragon agents already inside. Bracing herself against the disorientation that came with time travel, Bryna followed. Swirling sensations washed over her, similar and yet completely different from portal travel. The kaleidescope of colors was familiar, but she had never smelled cinnamon in a regular portal. As her vision cleared, she saw that the five of them had emerged into a shallow cave overlooking the Hillsbrad Foothills.</Text>

            <Text>
 The Dun Modr blacksmith's family welcomes two new twin babies, and their house is growing crowded. At the same time, Raynn is feeling confined and bored in the small outpost - she misses traveling with her mother, even if it was only between the internment camps. The dwarves of Dun Modr suggest a solution: to foster Raynn to their Wildhammer cousins in the Hinterlands. Raynn is eager to explore new lands, and the Wildhammers are willing, so Raynn moves to Aerie Peak. She is given a small room of her own in the keep, and begins training to ride the tame gryphons of the Wildhammers.
Raynn adapts to life with the Wildhammer dwarves in Aerie Peak. Training as a warrior, she merges her father's teachings with the dwarven style, wearing light leather armor and wielding a dwarven battle hammer. Fluent in orcish and dwarven languages, she becomes part of the Wildhammer dwarves' aerial reconnaissance force.

            <Title>Zul'Farrak</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bryna, Carolyn, and Elthas explore Zul'Farrak</Synopsis>
            <Text>Bryna looked around the ruins of Zul’Farrak with satisfaction. Carolyn and Elthas’s arrival in Gadgetzan had been just what she had needed, both in terms of her turmoil that day, and for this new adventure. Her experiences at the Caverns of Time now carefully cataloged away, she was glad to finally have the chance to explore this sand-swept city.
Sandstone walls, once intricately carved, but now crumbling, marked out the various sections of the Troll city. Within the walls, huts built from wood rose up over the sand on upright logs. Among the buildings, the undead remnants of the inhabitants rambled aimlessly. Aimless, unless one got too close, of course, which was why Elthas was plodding next to Bryna and Carolyn in his bear form.
Bryna knew that the druid wasn’t overly happy with the lumbering form, but it was a more effective protector for the two spell-casters. Raynn, they all knew, would be an even more effective protector, allowing Elthas to put his panther’s claws to good use on the annoyingly persistent undead. Raynn, however, was still finishing up her new breastplate.
Bryna had watched the warrior work for an afternoon, but while Raynn had worked, Trenton had once again regaled the mage with tales of enchanted artifacts to be found in Zul’Farrak. She had talked Elthas and Carolyn into joining her, making a well-rounded, if small, group.
They had made good progress through the city so far, although they hadn’t found much of interest yet. A few minor trinkets now rested at the bottom of Bryna’s backpack, but nothing like the treasures that Trenton had referred to.
Rounding a corner, they saw that they had come full circle, and were now once more facing the entrance to the city. Bryna frowned.
“I think this is it,” Carolyn said, her tone a mix of disappointment and relief. “I hate undead. They’re so persistent.”
Elthas shifted out of form. “Can we leave then?” He sounded so hopeful, Bryna had to nod ruefully.
Happily, the druid dropped down into cheetah form for the run back to Gadgetzan. Bryna pulled out her carpet as Carolyn whistled for her moonsaber.
“You’ll have to show me how that’s made sometime.” The priestess looked admiringly at the carpet, but the caress she gave to her mount made Bryna think she wouldn’t use it herself.
“I’ve heard there are patterns for flying carpets too,” the mage told Carolyn, and saw her own eagerness to learn such a thing reflected in the priestess’s grey eyes. Moonsabers, as far as Bryna knew, couldn’t fly. “I haven’t found the actual pattern yet though,” she admitted with disappointment.
Carolyn smiled though. “Someday, we’ll find it.” She was always so positive, and Bryna drank it in. The past couple of days in the presence of Carolyn’s optimism and Elthas’s enthusiasm had been refreshing.
Nudging her carpet forward, the mage followed the two felines out of the Troll ruins and back to Gadgetzan. A glance at the sky told her that it was almost time for lunch.
Lunch, it turned out, would have to wait.
As they rode through the gates back into the town, Carolyn gave a happy cry, “Kam!” as she saw a familiar black-clad figure standing by the forge watching Raynn work. She and Elthas rushed over to greet the rogue.
Bryna began to follow her friends, but another figure, standing near the southern entrance to the town caught her eye. A Quel’dorei child, standing quietly, watching her. He was far too calm for a young child, and watched her too knowingly. Bryna shifted her weight, sending her carpet drifting in that direction instead.
The boy acknowledged her with a half-bow when she approached. “Greetings Bryna.”
She hadn’t met him before, she was fairly sure. At least, not in this form, she supposed.
“I am Andormu,” the boy continued. “We need your assistance again at the Caverns.”
Well, that confirmed it. Bryna glanced over at her friends. She still hadn’t found a way to explain everything that had happened that day.
“Bring your friends,” Andormu invited, and Bryna felt that it wasn’t just a friendly suggestion.
“This time is worse?” She asked, and the boy nodded.
“I must return,” he said, turning to leave the town. “Come quickly.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Druids at the Park suggest Elthas is ready for further training at the Cenarian Enclave in Darnassus
- He says goodbye to his friends
- Bryna makes him a portal (for free)</Synopsis>
            <Text>Far from dark forests and Defias plots, Elthas curled his body through the cool water, reveling in the freedom of his new form—sea lion! Straightening out, he propelled his body swiftly through the waters surrounding Teldrassil. Whiskers twitched on his nose, but they were different now; instead of scents, they picked up temperature and currents. Curling around, he dove down as far as he could, until the rough, purplish rock of the ocean floor came into view.
The druid paused for a moment on the sea floor, watching the fish darting among the corals. Then, pushing off with a powerful movement, he streaked upwards, exultantly breaking the surface of the water. He drew in a deep breath, noting that the scent of the ocean and the breeze from Darkshore were more muted in this form. Dark eyes blinked in the bright sunlight, as he turned and dove back underwater, feeling the water flow smoothly around him. He twisted about with excitement. He couldn’t wait to show Carolyn! She took such delight in his different forms.
At the thought of the Human priestess, he slowed, drifting with the current momentarily. He would need to find her again, and that meant returning to Stormwind. His blunt nose wrinkled up at the thought of the stone city, but for his friend, it was worth it. Perhaps he could navigate the waters of the canals, rather than get lost in the streets. The thought brightened his mood, and turning smoothly, he cut through the water to the small dock at the edge of the Kaldorei homeland. The boat there would take him across to Auberdine, and then he could catch the larger ship to Menethil Harbor.</Text>

            <Text>As they approached the entrance to Onyxia’s lair, Bryna could see the powerful wards placed around the area. The rest of the riders slowed, dismounting near the entrance, as she moved to the forefront.
Dismounting herself, she reached into her bag for the now-repaired amulet. It gleamed in the shadows of the cave entrance, a glossy, dark light. The potent magic was even more powerful now, here at its source, and Bryna found herself wishing that she wore full gloves; she remembered the sizzling, dark blood that Kamery had collected, that had made this.
Grimacing, pushing the memories away, she held the amulet outstretched, and stepped forward. As the amulet passed them, the wards dropped. She held her position as the rest of the small band passed her, moving further down the dimly lit tunnel within.
Varian led the way, with Raynn and Broll just behind him. Bolvar Fordragon passed her next; the paladin gave her a small nod of acknowledgment. Kamery, Elthas, and Valeera slipped past after the paladin, disappearing almost instantly into the shadows of the cave. Carolyn and Jaina brought up the rear; the arch-mage smiled at Bryna, and she stepped into the cave, thankfully replacing the amulet in its protected pocket in her bag. The wards snapped shut behind her.
As they progressed further into the twisting tunnel, they encountered the first of Onyxia’s dragonspawn guards, and Varian thankfully allowed Raynn to take the lead. The dragonspawns were no match for their determination, and they quickly reached the massive oval chamber where the brood-mother lay.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Carolyn vs. Devilsaur - Melee priest ftw</Synopsis>
            <Text>As several weeks, passed, the group settled into a comfortable routine of exploration and training in the resource-rich crater. One balmy afternoon, Raynn rode her usual slow circuit around the perimeter of the crater, scanning the cliffs for the telltale shimmer of thorium. A nearby roar broke her focus—a devilsaur. She had become accustomed to their ground-shaking walk, but they only roared in combat.
Adrenaline mounting, Raynn turned her horse towards the sound, and was startled to a halt by a strange sight. At the edge of a clearing, Elthas sat placidly in feline form; one of his paws was idly bobbing in front of him, keeping some sort of silent beat.
In the middle of the clearing, Carolyn stood toe to toe with a massive devilsaur. The beast towered over her, roaring in anger as her staff smacked its leg. It bent to bite at her, and the staff landed a solid blow on its nose. Changing its attack, the beast swiped at the priestess with one sharp-taloned claw.
Carolyn’s shield of golden light shattered at the blow; she staggered slightly.
“Why are you not helping?” Raynn demanded of the druid.
Elthas gave a feline shrug. “Watch.”
As Carolyn muttered a holy word, the golden shield shimmered back into existence. Another word, and she stood straight once more. Her staff swung again, landing a heavy blow on the devilsaur’s shoulder. The beast stumbled, and Raynn realized that most of the mottling on its body was not natural coloring, but bruises from the staff.
Dumbfounded, she continued to watch, as Elthas nonchalantly licked his paw beside her. While she had known, mostly to her annoyance, about the priestess’s penchant for melee combat, she hadn’t realized the delicate blonde was this adept. Or this fierce, she amended, as the devilsaur finally succumbed to the assault.
Carolyn wasn’t quite finished surprising Raynn though. From her belt, she pulled a long slender knife, and began slicing into the devilsaur’s hide. As she worked, she occasionally glanced at Elthas for approval, but the druid was watching calmly.
Once Carolyn had finished removing the usable hide pieces from the massive beast, Elthas stood and approached her, smoothly shifting out of form. “Excellent work. You’ve learned well.”
Carolyn grinned happily as she handed the bundle of leather to the druid, and Raynn recognized her own lust for battle in that grin. The more time they spent together, the more hidden facets she discovered about her companions; she wondered if perhaps she might be able to share more of herself with them someday.</Text>

            <Title>Moving On</Title>
            <Text>Giving his head another shake to clear it, Elthas joined his companions as they silently made their way to the exit of the strange cavern. Time travel was strange. He had known, from stories, about the Horde. He and Carolyn had seen Orcs in Ashenvale and the Stonetalon Mountains, although only from a distance. This was the first time he had actually met one. Had actually realized that they were motivated by friendship and loyalty; that Orcs weren’t so different from Kaldorei or Humans.
“They could have at least let us explore a bit,” Bryna grumbled as she caught up to them. In their distraction, the other four had almost reached the exit before realizing that the mage had lingered behind them longer. “Dalaran wouldn’t have been that far.” There was a wistful tone in her voice.
Elthas’s tail twitched in agreement. The rolling green hills and lush pine forests surrounding Durnholde Keep had been fresh and beautiful.
Raynn shook her head, setting her ponytail swaying. Elthas pulled his attention away from the hypnotic sight to listen to the warrior’s answer. “They wouldn’t have let us in anyway.” Her voice was still distant, but the tightness had lifted. The warrior had a lot of anger and pain in her past, he realized. Perhaps, he hoped, looking around the reunited group, her friends would be able to help her heal.
Together, the five emerged into the heat of the Tanaris desert. Elthas shuddered at the heat, and beside him, he felt Carolyn’s moonsaber do the same. The priestess, attuned to the great cat, reached down to pat it with a soothing hand. He would have to tell the saber-handlers in Darnassus how well the Human was treating the Kaldorei mount.
“Are we staying in Tanaris much longer?” the priestess asked. “Do you need to do anything more with Trenton?” She looked questioningly at Raynn.
The warrior shook her head again, and Elthas forced himself not to watch the auburn ponytail. It was even more distracting than the other Humans’ horses’ tails as they ran.
“Un’goro Crater,” Bryna declared. “It’s rich with resources.”
Kamery laughed, drawing looks from the others, and Elthas remembered Bryna’s suggestion that the rogue sell the herbs that she had collected back in the Wetlands.
The matter was settled quickly, and they returned to the inn in Tanaris to gather their things. It was near midday, so they stopped for one last lunch from Dirge Quickcleave—the Goblin’s cooking was exquisite, even to Elthas’s Kaldorei senses.
After lunch, Raynn bid a brief, but heartfelt, goodbye to Trenton Lighthammer, and they set off, once more following Bryna’s lead through the rolling dunes to a new, unexplored, and—most importantly to Elthas—vegetation-filled land.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Onyxia's fear spells is debilitating
- Raynn remembers Grom's lessons, including his last words to her - spoken in the haze of demonic bloodlust, but still valuable
- Raynn's shout of rage breaks the others out of their paralysis
- Group defeats Onyxia</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn faced the looming menace of Onyxia, the black dragon in her element in her lair of fire and ash. Despite all of the challenges and battles they had faced, there was something about the fearsome dragon that stripped away training and experience, and left them exposed.
Onyxia roared, her voice imbued with magic. Insidious tendrils crept into the minds of the group, rendering them immobile with terror. Frantically, Carolyn worked to unravel the spells, but was quickly overwhelmed. The others, overwhelmed by the dragon’s magic, were vulnerable.
Raynn felt her resolve slipping away in the face of the onslaught, struggling to maintain her grip, to shield her friends and allies.
&quot;You must face the fury within you, Raynn. Embrace the power that courses through your veins.” The words resounded in her mind suddenly, a long-forgotten echo from a tormented mentor. The memory of the wild blows, barely controlled, rose up in her. There was power there - a different kind of power than the carefully controlled defensive style that she had honed over the past years.
Raynn’s shield dropped from its protective position as she took a more aggressive stance. The fear still echoed through her mind, but she embraced it. Drawing strength from it, she allowed it to boil up and out of her in an inarticulate roar of rage.
Her voice broke through her allies’ paralysis, spurring them to action. Frost gathered around Bryna’s fingers and was hurled with deadly accuracy at the onyx dragon. Jaina’s arcane missiles joined the chilly bolts. Elthas and Broll leaped back into the fray with renewed fury, snarling as their claws ripped shreds out of their foe’s hide.
Carolyn, with a small smile of gratitude, drew on the Light, mending Raynn’s wounds. Although not a warrior herself, Carolyn had done enough healing in her adventures to recognize the value of a well-positioned shield. She accepted the added healing burden gladly though, knowing that Raynn had made the sacrifice in exchange for valuable offensive support.
Kamery’s and Valeera’s daggers flashed, pinpointing vulnerabilities in the scaled hide. Onyxia roared once more, but this time from pain. Bolvar’s broadsword swung down in a heavy blow, shattering an obsidian scale on the brood-mother’s shoulder. Icicles gathered around Bryna’s head, coalesced into a deadly projectile, and launched at the dragon.
Grimacing from the pain the dragon’s razor-sharp claws were inflicting, Raynn swung her sword with all her strength and rage. Her parents, slain by their own kind, fueled by fear and hatred. Grommash, tormented by demons until his moment of death. Even Thrall, his memories of their battles erased by indifferent bronze dragons.
Varian, fueled by his own pain and rage, struck successive blows with his dual swords, taking advantage of the opening Bolvar had created. Onyxia fell, her eyes losing the burning light.
Raynn stood still for a moment, catching her breath, and gathering her thoughts. All of her losses, all of her anger, faded back away again, swept away under the friendship and camaraderie she shared with the jubilant group that now surrounded her. The feelings lingered, to be sure, but now under control. She knew she could harness them again, learn to master and use them, just as Grom had once instructed.</Text>

            <Text>The night air in Stormwind was crisp, carrying the scent of blooming flowers from the gardens. Raynn found herself at the entrance of the keep, where Anduin was often found, contemplating the weight of leadership. As she approached, she noticed Anduin standing alone, looking out over the city.

&quot;Anduin,&quot; Raynn called softly, not wanting to startle him.

Anduin turned, a warm smile lighting up his face as he saw Raynn approaching. &quot;Raynn, it's good to see you. What brings you here?&quot;

Raynn leaned against the stone railing, her eyes scanning the city below. &quot;Just checking in on you. Leading isn't easy, especially in times like these.&quot;

Anduin nodded, appreciating the understanding in Raynn's voice. &quot;It's a heavy burden, but I'm doing my best.&quot;

&quot;I know you are,&quot; Raynn said, her gaze lingering on Anduin. There was a shared understanding between them, a connection that went beyond words.

Unbeknownst to them, Wrathion observed from the shadows, his keen eyes missing nothing. The Black Prince had been drawn to the intriguing dance of emotions unfolding between Raynn and Anduin.

As Raynn and Anduin continued their conversation, Wrathion approached with a confident stride. &quot;Well, well, what do we have here?&quot; he mused, a playful smirk on his lips.

Raynn turned to face Wrathion, her expression a mix of curiosity and amusement. &quot;And what brings the Black Prince to this cozy gathering?&quot;

Wrathion chuckled. &quot;I couldn't resist the allure of such fascinating company. The two most intriguing figures in Stormwind, together.&quot;

Anduin raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in his eyes. &quot;Fascinating, indeed. What brings you, Wrathion?&quot;

The Black Prince leaned against the railing, his gaze alternating between Raynn and Anduin. &quot;Just enjoying the view and the company, of course. Stormwind's beauty is only enhanced by the interesting conversations that unfold within its walls.&quot;

The trio continued to converse, each word and glance carrying the unspoken complexities of their relationships. The night held the promise of more conversations, more shared moments, and the city below seemed to bask in the glow of the connections formed in its shadowy corners.</Text>

            <Title>Sneaky Sneaks</Title>
            <Synopsis>- The group sets off for Moonbrook
- First fight, with a group of Defias
- They reach the steel door
- Elthas and Kamery scout side tunnels first</Synopsis>
            <Text>Elthas bounded eagerly across the plains of Westfall. The tall yellow grass rustled and tickled against his sleek black fur. The wind carried the scent of the dry farmland, mixed with intriguing hints of salt water. In the east, the sun was slowly moving higher in the sky, still casting long shadows behind the occasional trees that he passed. His keen ears picked up the screech of a bird of prey overhead. Hawk, he decided.
Behind him, the four young Humans he was traveling with strode purposefully down the curving dirt road towards the village of Moonbrook. Every now and then, Elthas circled back to check on their steady progress. He relished Carolyn’s company—had since their first encounter last year, battling troublesome sprites in the wilds of Teldrassil. The priestess had been delighted by his shape-shifting and he, in turn, had been intrigued by the enthusiastic Human. Their shared passion for adventure and exploration had led them through Darkshore, Ashenvale, and Stonetalon. Now, they had returned to her homeland, to help her sister.
Elthas paused for a moment to breathe more deeply, his tail twitching at the new and exciting scents of the unfamiliar continent. The oily smell of the field mechanisms made him sneeze, but he found the other scents of the farms to be pleasant enough. They were different from what he knew, but still natural.
The Humans were close to Moonbrook, so Elthas broke from his brief contemplation to dash past them, and into the town. In the early morning, the shadows lay long between the small cottages. His black fur blended in as he carefully padded from one building to the next, senses alert for trouble. Nobody was stirring yet, which seemed a good sign. Reaching the fountain at the center of the town, he gave the streets one last look, and turned back to meet his companions.
Approaching them from the direction of the town, he was amused to see their surprise. Shifting quickly out of feline form, he reported, “The town seems empty so far. Nobody stirring from here to the fountain.” He noticed Kamery’s eyebrows raise above her bandanna, and she gave him an appraising look. He smiled down at her, the expression feeling odd on his face; he was far more familiar with the open grin of the panther, although he understood that some people found that disconcerting.
With no immediate threats, he decided to walk alongside them for a while. Entering the town, the group was more alert now, despite his assurance. Raynn unslung her shield from her back, settling it on her left arm. With her right, she drew her sword with a practiced maneuver. Kamery also drew her daggers, their edges gleaming a sickly green. He reminded himself not to breath too deeply around her when he shifted.
Carolyn looked more alert, although she was still holding her staff loosely at her side. Bryna was the only one who appeared unperturbed, strolling easily through the town, her staff nowhere in sight—Elthas suspected that she had somehow stowed it in her backpack. Magical bags were not uncommon, but fitting an entire staff in one was tricky. He knew, as he had tried it himself a few times, before he had mastered shifting his staff as part of him. The heavy wooden weapon became an extension of his body, lending its weight to his paws.
They passed through the still-sleeping town, meeting no resistance. As they entered the dilapidated barn that Kamery had described, Elthas dropped back into panther form. The cat’s keen vision took in the meager piles of hay on the rough stone floor, and the staircase leading upwards, exactly as Kamery had drawn on her map. Moving away from the group, Elthas breathed deeply, but smelled only moldering hay and rotting wood.
He padded softly up the stairs, feeling Kamery next to him, her steps just as silent as his. His ears twitched in appreciation. Together, they leaped lightly down into the tunnels below. Behind them, the other Humans followed, and Elthas winced at the clatter of Raynn’s plate boots. They wouldn’t be able to confront the Defias leader alone though, so the sound was an unfortunate necessity. As they progressed further down the tunnel, the rhythmic tapping of the mining operation reached them, covering any sounds they were making. 
Coming out into an open area, they stood unnoticed for a moment, observing the bustle of activity. Gnolls grunted as they pushed heavy mine carts filled with raw ores further down the tunnels. Kobolds wielding pickaxes cut away at the sides of the chamber, overseen by a handful of Human Defias ruffians, in their signature red bandannas.
“Amateurs,” mumbled Raynn, as she watched the miners.
“Intruders!” A shout went up from one of the overseers, as they were spotted. The kobolds and gnolls scattered into the deeper tunnels, but four of the Defias surged forwards, drawing rapiers.
“King’s business!” Raynn shouted. “Surrender, and—” She didn’t get to finish as the attackers were on her. Her shout had served its purpose though, drawing their attention to her. The single-minded focus gave Elthas a chance to slip around behind them, and he spotted Kamery doing the same, her wicked dagger poised.
Adrenaline surged through him as he stalked his prey. The words of his druidic masters flowed though him, a soothing balm, “Embrace your instinct; use it. Do not become it.” Silently, Elthas pounced, his claws raking at his target’s unprotected back. The Human cried out in pain and spun towards him. A solid blow of Raynn’s shield on his now-exposed side quickly pulled his attention back to the warrior.
Raynn’s sword and shield seemed extensions of her body, as she used both for offense and defense. With her measured attacks and occasional taunts, she effectively held their opponents’ attention. Carolyn’s healing spells suffused the group with warm energy.
Elthas was aware of Kamery beside him, her daggers working more strategically than his claws, finding weaknesses in their opponents, and spreading their poisons. A chill made him shiver as Bryna’s spells landed. A flash of white cloth in the corner of his vision alerted him to Carolyn’s presence. The priestess had a strange affinity for physical attacks, laying about herself with her staff. She was quite adept at it.
One of their opponents, sensing a less-protected target, turned on her, thrusting his rapier to disembowel Carolyn. It would have, but it glanced off of a shimmering shield of holy energy that surrounded the priestess. Surprise almost made Raynn miss her next block, and Carolyn shot her a disapproving look.
“Don’t make me heal you now,” the priestess chastised. Elthas saw the warrior’s eyes widen in disbelief as she automatically parried the next strike aimed at her.
“What are you doing?” Raynn demanded, ducking under another wild swing.
Carolyn shrugged, and swung her staff again, striking one of the Defias in the chest, knocking the wind out of him. Elthas’s claws took advantage of the distraction to finish the Human off.
“You block too well.” Carolyn made the compliment sound like a complaint.
As the fight ended, their unyielding opponents falling, the group stood for a moment, catching their breath. Elthas sat back on his haunches, licking the blood from one paw. His shining eyes watched in amusement as Raynn turned to Carolyn with an incredulous look. “That was dangerous!”
Carolyn met the warrior’s ire with calm stubbornness. “Nobody needed healing.”
Raynn heaved a sigh, “That was just a skirmish.”
Carolyn nodded. “I know what I’m doing.”
Bryna broke the tension, interjecting, “It would be nice if they all just surrendered, but it doesn’t seem they’re going to make this easy on us.”
Kamery shook her head ruefully. Carolyn whispered one last spell, a determined look on her face that Elthas knew well. Their opponents may be obdurate, but Carolyn, beneath her beatific demeanor, was just as unyielding.
The wide central chamber was deserted now, and they made their way over to the large steel door at one end.
“I suspect their main operation is in here,” Kamery speculated. “Perhaps we should check the side tunnels though?”
Elthas padded over to the rogue, and nudged her hand with his head. He could speak in his panther form, but it took effort. Luckily she understood.
Gesturing to the other three, Kamery instructed, “Stay here, Elthas and I will scout.” She smiled down at the druid. He nodded and quietly made his way over to the first tunnel.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Carolyn deals with emotions
- Varian is worried about Anduin and anxious to unmask Onyxia
- Kamery suggests they see what Shaw has to say
- They all return to Elwynn</Synopsis>
            <Text>As she leaned into Elthas and Kamery’s embrace, emotions swirled through Carolyn. Grief and loss, yes, but those she had come to terms with over time. More recently, and more sharply though, she felt guilt. She had been so wrapped up in her own thoughts and desires a year ago; she had left Kamery alone in Stormwind.
At the time, she had felt almost intimidated by Kamery’s role with SI:7, and her sister had seemed strong and invulnerable. It hadn’t been until the request for aid in Westfall that Carolyn had realized that Kamery needed her as much as she had once relied on her sister’s strength during their parents’ illness.
She had felt helpless, powerless, as her rudimentary spells did nothing. Now, remembering the futile efforts of the other priests, and knowing more about the nature of life and death, she realized that there was no fault there. Nonetheless, she had taken advantage of her childhood whims, and run away.
“I’m sorry,” Carolyn whispered to Kamery, but her sister just held her tighter, silently telling her that there was no need.
As they exchanged quiet understanding, the emotional moment was broken by Raynn’s throat-clearing. The warrior was trying to be tactful, but it went against her nature.
Drying her eyes with one hand, Carolyn looked up to see Varian striding towards them, a stormy look on his face. That look softened somewhat when he noticed her state, but his determination did not fade.
“Maxwell is being singularly unhelpful.” The King growled. “Every moment we waste is one moment longer that my son is in the clutches of that beast. His life has already been threatened. We must unmask her, yet we still know nothing of the situation in Stormwind.”
Kamery faced Varian. “We will accompany you, but I believe we should stop in Elwynn Forest first.” She proffered Shaw’s terse invitation and the King scanned it. Kamery addressed his confusion. “He means the cottage that Carolyn and I grew up in. It is abandoned now, but lies not far from the gates of Stormwind.”
Varian nodded shortly. “If anyone knows the situation in Stormwind, it is Mathias Shaw.”
With their path once more tied to that of the King, the small group set forth on the journey that would take them south through Redridge and then west, past Three Corners, and into Elwynn Forest.</Text>

            <Text>In the aftermath of the defeat of N'Zoth, Stormwind Keep bustled with activity as the city celebrated a hard-earned victory. Raynn found herself summoned to the keep, where Anduin awaited, flanked by the mysterious Black Prince, Wrathion.
Entering the regal chamber, Raynn noticed the air was charged with a mixture of relief and uncertainty. Anduin acknowledged her with a nod, and Wrathion, his eyes sharp and calculating, regarded her silently. The atmosphere hinted at the weight of the recent events.
Anduin spoke first, gratitude in his voice. &quot;Raynn, thank you for your unwavering courage and dedication throughout this ordeal. The realm owes you a great debt.&quot;
Raynn bowed slightly, acknowledging the praise. &quot;It was an honor to fight alongside you, Your Majesty.&quot;
Wrathion interjected, his tone measured. &quot;Indeed, Raynn. Your actions have undoubtedly played a crucial role in preserving Azeroth. We find ourselves in a pivotal moment.&quot;
Anduin nodded in agreement. &quot;True, and with that in mind, I've sought counsel from allies and friends.&quot;
Raynn raised an eyebrow, silently urging him to continue.
Wrathion stepped forward, his gaze piercing. &quot;The world has changed, and so must our approach. Raynn, I've observed your prowess, and your unique connection to the Heart of Azeroth. I believe we have the potential to shape the destiny of our world.&quot;
Anduin added, &quot;The council I propose will bring together champions from all corners of Azeroth, individuals whose skills and experiences can guide us into the uncertain future. I ask you to be a part of this council.&quot;
Raynn considered the gravity of the moment. The honor of being entrusted with such a responsibility was not lost on her. She took a deep breath before responding. &quot;Your Majesty, Black Prince, I am humbled by your faith in me. I accept this responsibility with a sense of duty and dedication to Azeroth.&quot;
Anduin smiled, his trust evident. &quot;Welcome to the council, Raynn. Together, we will face whatever challenges lie ahead.&quot;
As the three figures stood in the heart of Stormwind Keep, united by purpose, they prepared to navigate the uncertain path that awaited them in the ever-evolving world of Azeroth.

With romantic subtext:
The grand chamber in Stormwind Keep was bathed in the soft glow of candlelight as Anduin, Wrathion, and Raynn convened. The atmosphere was charged with the lingering energy of recent victories and the weight of unspoken emotions.
Anduin, clad in regal attire, regarded Raynn with a gentle smile. &quot;Raynn, your bravery has been a beacon in these trying times. I'm grateful to have you by my side.&quot;
Raynn met his gaze, a mixture of respect and warmth in her eyes. &quot;Your Majesty, the honor is mine. Together, we've faced formidable foes and triumphed.&quot;
Wrathion observed the exchange, his keen eyes catching every nuance. &quot;Indeed, Raynn, your prowess has been commendable. It seems the battles have forged bonds that extend beyond the battlefield.&quot;
Anduin's expression remained affable, though there was a subtle twinkle in his eyes. &quot;Speaking of bonds, I've been contemplating the future of Azeroth. A future that requires unity and trust.&quot;
Raynn's curiosity piqued, and she nodded. &quot;Unity is essential in these uncertain times.&quot;
Wrathion stepped closer, his gaze unwavering. &quot;Trust is a rare commodity, especially when the fate of a world hangs in the balance. Yet, it seems trust has grown among us.&quot;
Anduin's eyes met Raynn's with a sincerity that transcended the conversation at hand. &quot;Indeed, trust is crucial. The bond we share goes beyond duty. It's a foundation we can build upon for the challenges ahead.&quot;
Raynn felt a warmth spread within her, a connection that extended beyond alliances. She spoke softly, her words carrying unspoken layers. &quot;Your Majesty, Black Prince, the trust we've cultivated is a strength that can guide us. I am ready to face whatever lies ahead, together.&quot;
Anduin's gaze lingered, a shared understanding passing between them. &quot;Then, let our unity be the beacon that lights our path forward.&quot;
As the trio continued their discussion, the undercurrent of connection and understanding hinted at uncharted territories, leaving the promise of shared destinies in the air.

With romance:
The opulent chamber in Stormwind Keep was illuminated by the soft glow of candles, casting a warm ambiance. Anduin, Wrathion, and Raynn gathered, the air thick with unspoken emotions and the afterglow of recent victories.
Anduin, regal in his attire, turned his gaze to Raynn, a soft smile playing on his lips. &quot;Raynn, your courage has been a light in the darkness. I am grateful to have you at my side.&quot;
Raynn met his gaze, a twinkle of something more than camaraderie in her eyes. &quot;Your Majesty, the honor is mine. Together, we have faced formidable foes and emerged victorious.&quot;
Wrathion observed the exchange, his sharp eyes keenly attuned to the subtle dance of emotions. &quot;Indeed, Raynn, your prowess on the battlefield has been impressive. It seems the trials we've faced have forged bonds that go beyond mere alliances.&quot;
Anduin's expression held a gentle warmth as he continued to regard Raynn. &quot;Speaking of bonds, I've been reflecting on the future of Azeroth. A future that necessitates unity and, perhaps, deeper connections.&quot;
Raynn's curiosity flickered, and she nodded. &quot;Unity is crucial in times like these.&quot;
Wrathion stepped closer, a mischievous glint in his eye. &quot;Unity, yes. But perhaps there's room for more, a connection that transcends duty and alliance.&quot;
Anduin's gaze never wavered from Raynn's as he spoke with a touch of vulnerability. &quot;Raynn, the battles we've faced together have forged a bond between us. A bond that I find myself wanting to explore further.&quot;
Raynn felt a soft flutter in her chest, a warmth that surpassed the glow of the candles. &quot;Your Majesty, Anduin, the connection we share is undeniable. Perhaps it's time to acknowledge that it goes beyond duty and friendship.&quot;
Wrathion, ever the provocateur, chimed in with a knowing smile. &quot;Love has the power to be the strongest force in any realm. Perhaps it's time for hearts to find their course.&quot;
As the trio navigated the delicate dance of emotions, the air crackled with the promise of a romance unfolding amidst the backdrop of Azeroth's challenges. The warmth of candlelight reflected the glow of newfound feelings, casting a soft radiance over the trio on the precipice of something more.

With romance between all three:
The grandeur of Stormwind Keep's chamber provided an elegant setting, lit by the soft glow of candles that seemed to dance with secrets. Anduin, Wrathion, and Raynn stood in a triangular formation, their hearts echoing the unsaid sentiments that lingered in the air.
Anduin, with a regal bearing, turned his gaze between Raynn and Wrathion. &quot;Raynn, Wrathion, we have faced incredible challenges together. The bonds forged in the crucible of adversity go beyond mere camaraderie.&quot;
Raynn met Anduin's eyes, a subtle spark of understanding passing between them. &quot;Your Majesty, our journey has revealed the strength that lies in unity and... unexpected connections.&quot;
Wrathion, standing with an air of enigmatic allure, spoke with a playful lilt. &quot;Unity indeed, and yet, there are threads of a deeper connection woven into our shared destiny. Something that goes beyond the realms of duty.&quot;
Anduin, ever the diplomat, approached Raynn with a genuine expression. &quot;Raynn, in the quiet moments of reflection, I've come to realize that the bonds we share might be destined for more than duty. More than what's expected.&quot;
Raynn felt the magnetic pull of their connection, her heart echoing the unspoken desires. &quot;Your Majesty, Wrathion, the journey we've embarked upon has illuminated paths we might not have dared to explore. Perhaps it's time to acknowledge the depths of what binds us.&quot;
Wrathion, wearing a sly smile, moved closer, creating an intimate triangle between them. &quot;In the tapestry of Azeroth, threads of love can weave a story that transcends the ages. Why resist the currents that guide hearts?&quot;
The chamber, filled with the intoxicating mix of candlelight and unspoken emotions, witnessed a subtle shift. Anduin, Raynn, and Wrathion stood on the precipice of a romance that defied conventions, where the lines between duty, friendship, and love blurred in the face of destiny. The air buzzed with a promise, as if the very foundations of Stormwind Keep acknowledged the emergence of an unconventional tryst amid the grandeur of Azeroth's challenges.</Text>

            <Text>Thrall surveyed the landscape, the nascent Orgrimmar sprawling below as a testament to the orcish determination. The echoes of construction filled the air, and his mind was preoccupied with the burdens of leadership. The orcs needed a new home, and Durotar would be that sanctuary.
As he stood on the hillside, his thoughts were interrupted by Raynn's arrival. Her presence was a stark reminder of the past, of promises made and battles faced. Thrall could sense her unease, a reflection of the trials she had endured.
Raynn's question about Grom Hellscream shifted the atmosphere. The weight of Grom's sacrifice lay heavy on Thrall's shoulders. He hesitated before delivering the somber news, the reality of Grom's heroic end reverberating through the words.
Raynn's reaction mirrored the grief and gratitude intertwined in Thrall's heart. The scars hidden beneath her clothing bore witness to the trials they had faced together. The loss of Grom, the mentor and protector, echoed through the hills, leaving behind a void that Thrall recognized too well.
&quot;I didn't know,&quot; Raynn's whispered words reached him, carrying the weight of a shared journey. Thrall met her gaze, understanding the complex emotions that threaded their connection.

            <Synopsis>- Bryna, Elthas, Carolyn split ways
- Elthas goes to visit the Stormwind Park
- Carolyn goes to the Cathedral
- Bryna returns to the Mage Tower</Synopsis>
            <Text>Carolyn shuddered at Bryna’s suggestion of a vest, but she suspected that the mage had only been teasing. She hoped that the mage had been teasing. Studying Bryna’s face now, she had to admit that she wasn’t quite sure.
Although she could make a new robe for herself, it would take time, and Carolyn realized that she hadn’t yet visited the Cathedral. She had been there twice during her training in Northshire, before her trip to Kalimdor, and the soaring building had impressed her. The priests there were not as combat-oriented as her trainers in Northshire, and she wondered if they might have some useful instruction for her now.
Looking down at her robe, with its multiple repairs and patches, and currently two new gaping tears, she knew she couldn’t go there like this. Bryna’s invitation was certainly appealing.
“Alright,” she agreed. “A new robe sounds nice.” She carefully emphasized the clothing item that she wanted, and saw Bryna’s lips twitch.
“We don’t deal with leather,” the mage said apologetically to Elthas, “but you’re welcome to come along if you want?”
The sleek black panther at their feet shook his head, shifting smoothly out of form again. “I want to visit the druids in the Park,” he told them. His features crinkled with confusion as he looked around the busy streets. “Where is it again?”
Carolyn felt a pang of sympathy. She knew why Kamery had been concerned about them, although her sister had apparently forgotten that Bryna had grown up in the city.
“Come with us,” Bryna invited. “It’s just across the canal from the Mage District. We’ll go the long way around,” she told Carolyn, “and show him the right bridge.”
Carolyn nodded, happy to follow the confident mage’s lead. Elthas gave a small bow of gratitude, before he shifted back into his feline form.
Bryna led them out of the busy Trade District, casting a wistful glance at the trading house as they walked by. The clamor of voices within could be heard even out in the busy streets. As they passed under the stone arch leading to the canal-side, the bustle and noise of the district died down immediately, and Carolyn felt Elthas’s step lighten next to her, regaining some of its usual springiness.
Staying on the canal-side pathway, they retraced their earlier steps, across one of the city’s low bridges and past the massive stone building that housed the Stockades. Feeling her friends’ eyes on her, Carolyn smiled at them reassuringly. Elthas accepted her expression, and bounded eagerly ahead across the open cobblestone square. Bryna’s eyes lingered a little longer, but then she also seemed to accept Carolyn’s attitude.
Carolyn understood their concern. The feeling of falling, the darkness closing in, had been intense. But it wasn’t the first time it had happened, and she was certain that it wouldn’t be the last. Her spirit was anchored firmly in Azeroth though, as were theirs. The weakness of her body couldn’t break that spirit.
Pulling her thoughts away from the memory, Carolyn looked around the square with interest. Although she knew that most of the shops of the Mage Quarter were on the inner side, facing the tower in the center, there were a few small shops on this side too. Signs proclaimed enchanting reagents and magical wands.
Carolyn chuckled silently at the memory of her trainers trying to teach her to use a wand. She had never been able to get the timing quite right. She felt much more comfortable swinging her heavy staff.
Coming around the far side of the Stockade, they could now see the Park across the canal. A bridge arched over the water not far ahead to the right, and on the left, an opening led into the Mage District, between the crowded buildings. Elthas stopped at the near end of the bridge, waiting for them to reach him.
“See you soon!” he said, anticipation for his visit to the Park quickening the voice emerging from the panther’s throat. Carolyn knew that the stone city had been wearing on him. It had been a bit much for her too, after the past year in the wilds of Kalimdor; even the Kaldorei city of Darnassus was entwined with nature. Bryna, of course, looked completely at ease as she waved goodbye to the druid and beckoned Carolyn to follow her.
With a wave of her own, Carolyn followed the confident mage into the twisting maze of the Mage Quarter. Her earlier visits, both at the other entrance, had been brief and the path had seemed more straightforward. On this side, however, she could already see the path ahead of them branching and turning. From her right, a pungent aroma assaulted her, and she wrinkled her nose at the unpleasant mix. Brimstone and blood and something else she didn’t want to dwell on long enough to figure out.
“Ugh, I always forget the Lamb is so close to this entrance,” Bryna grumbled, guiding them in the opposite direction. She obviously knew the Quarter well, her steps unerring, and they soon emerged in a wide central lawn, dominated by the tall white stone tower. Smooth stone rose up high overhead, before flaring out into a wider, crenelated turret at the top. A sweeping ramp curved around the tower, leading up from the lawn. After passing around the entire circumference of the tower, the ramp disappeared into an open doorway at the base of the turret.
Bryna paused at the bottom of the ramp, looking up. “I should see if they have any new spells,” she stated, already moving past the end of the ramp. “Robes first, though!” Turning left, the mage led them into a small shop on the perimeter of the area, under a sign that declared, “Duncan’s Textiles”.
Carolyn paused for a moment, letting her eyes adjust from the bright afternoon sun outside. She could smell the familiar scents of linen and cotton, as well as more exotic silk and something she couldn’t identify, but which reminded her of the enchantments that Bryna had woven into her robe. An appalled gasp to her left told her where the shop owner was, and she suddenly felt self-conscious in her battered robe.
As her eyes adjusted, she made out a tall man in an immaculate suit standing behind a counter that ran the entire length of the shop. A dazzling array of bolts of cloth lined the wall behind him, ranging from rough wools to shimmering silks. On the opposite side, to her right, a handful of wooden figures held a sampling of ready-to-wear clothing, their enchantments shimmering in the light that filtered in through windows at the far end of the room.
“Dad,” Bryna spoke firmly, “this is Carolyn, a priestess. She needs a new robe.”
“Of course she does!” exclaimed a well-dressed woman as she approached Carolyn from the far end of the shop. One of her hands plucked at the recently repaired sleeve. “At least you tried,” she sniffed at Bryna, and Carolyn almost laughed at the mage’s indignant expression.
As Bryna’s father recovered his composure, he began pulling out a variety of robes. The mage’s mother guided Carolyn to a small room to one side where she could finally remove her own tattered garment. As she began trying on the proffered robes, Carolyn decided that she was in good hands.</Text>

            <Title>Approach</Title>
            <Text>The moon hung high in the Draenor sky, casting a silver glow over the rugged landscape surrounding Lunarfall. Raynn, the resolute commander of the Alliance Garrison, surveyed the activity below. The campfires flickered, and soldiers went about their duties, preparing for the challenges that awaited them beyond the safety of their stone walls.
Varian Wrynn, the imposing King of Stormwind, strode purposefully through the garrison grounds. His presence commanded attention, his armor gleaming in the moonlight. As he approached Raynn, the air seemed to carry the weight of unspoken tensions.
&quot;Commander,&quot; Varian greeted with a nod, his piercing eyes meeting Raynn's.
&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Raynn replied, her gaze meeting his without hesitation. She respected his rank but refused to let it overshadow her commitment to the mission.
Varian's eyes lingered on her, and he couldn't help but notice the strength that emanated from Raynn. Her straightforward demeanor, a stark contrast to the political intricacies of Stormwind, left him both intrigued and, at times, unsettled.
Raynn's voice broke the silence, &quot;We're preparing for the next assault on the Iron Horde. Our forces are ready, and we won't let them advance any further.&quot;
Varian nodded, his jaw clenched. He respected Raynn's determination but found her lack of deference irksome. Tiffin's memory lingered, a subtle ache that colored his interactions with strong-willed women.
&quot;I've heard reports of Horde activity in the vicinity,&quot; Varian said, his tone measured. &quot;We must remain vigilant. The Horde cannot be trusted.&quot;
Raynn's brows furrowed, a flicker of disagreement in her eyes. &quot;Respecting our allies is crucial, Your Majesty. We share a common enemy in the Iron Horde. Let's not undermine that unity.&quot;
Varian's gaze hardened, his anger simmering beneath the surface. He valued strength, but Raynn's unwavering belief in the Horde tested his patience.
&quot;Strength comes from unity, Commander,&quot; Varian asserted, his voice carrying the weight of Stormwind's legacy.
Raynn met his gaze unflinchingly, her response unwavering. &quot;Unity, yes, but not blind hatred. We can be strong without succumbing to the same darkness we fight against.&quot;
Varian's jaw tightened, the tension palpable. Raynn's words echoed in the quiet night, a reminder of the ideological divide that lingered between them.
As Varian turned to leave, his gaze lingered on Raynn, a complex mix of admiration and frustration. In the moonlit silence of Lunarfall, their differences stood stark, yet an unspoken understanding lingered—an acknowledgment of shared strength and a shared burden in the face of Draenor's trials.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Elthas remembers to scout ahead</Synopsis>
            <Text>His combat instincts dying down, Elthas faded back into the shadows. Kamery was busy looking for the Marshal’s information, so he knew it was up to him to scout ahead now. He had forgotten twice already now. He wouldn’t let his friends down again. Silently, he padded up the ramp past Carolyn and Bryna. Overhearing the Human King’s apology to Carolyn, his feline mouth pulled into a pleased smile, but he didn’t stop.
Crossing the room above, Elthas slipped down the opposite ramp. The Manufactory, as their Dark Iron guide had called it, was filled with cluttered workbenches and strange machinery. Support pillars stretched to the ceiling at regular intervals. The air was filled with the crackle of electricity and the pungent smell of ozone threatened to make him sneeze.
Suppressing the urge, Elthas crept down the central corridor. To both sides, he noted small groups of industrious Gnomes gathered around workbenches. They seemed to be assembling mechanical golems from an unfamiliar dark metal; it smelled like iron, but changed somehow. That they were happily working here, under no apparent duress, didn’t bode well.
To his right, a doorway at the far side of the room led out to another bridge. The reddish glow that under-lit the stone suggested that this bridge also crossed magma. His muzzle wrinkled, both at the smells, and the extent of this underground city. He hoped that Kamery had found what they needed, and they could leave soon.
Directly ahead, an unusually tall Dark Iron Dwarf paced in a smaller office, stopping occasionally to scribble notes on a piece of paper resting on a stack of crates. Two completed golems stood to either side of the room. Elthas cocked his head curiously. More papers lay haphazardly around the small office—on the floor and on the stone benches. Hopefully the rest of the information they sought was among the scattered pages.
Deciding that he had seen enough, and been gone long enough, Elthas turned back. The ramp hadn’t been that wide, and his Kaldorei form had broad shoulders; if he timed it correctly, perhaps he could slow down the reckless warriors.</Text>

            <Title>Common Writing Mistakes</Title>
            <Text>Are You Making This #1 Amateur Writing Mistake?

It doesn’t sound fair.
It doesn’t seem right.
But here’s a dirty little secret of the writing life you need to hear:
Any veteran editor can tell within two minutes whether they’re going to reject your manuscript.
It takes longer to decide whether they’ll recommend it for purchase, of course, but—sad to say—it can, and often does, go into the reject pile just that fast.
“What?” you say. “Before I’ve had a chance to wow them with my stupendous villain? Before my mind-blowing twist? Before my plot really takes off?”
Sorry.
And I’m not exaggerating.
Why?
Because the competition is so stiff and editors have so many manuscripts to read, you have only nanoseconds to grab them by the throat and hang on.
Every writing mentor hammers at this ad infinitum: Your editor is your first reader.
Every word counts. You get one chance. You must capture them from the get-go.
Am I saying editors look for reasons to reject your work?
No, no, a thousand times no! They’re looking for the next Harry Potter!
Editors want you to succeed!
Then how can they know so quickly that your book won’t cut it?
In my lifetime in the business I’ve heard dozens of reasons, but let me give you my personal top five from my experience as both an editor and publisher:
Throat-clearing
This is what editors call anything that comes before a story or chapter finally, really, begins. It usually consists of a page or two of scene setting and background. Get on with the story. Get your main character introduced, establish and upset some status quo, then plunge him into terrible trouble that reveals the engine of your story. Is it a quest, a journey, a challenge, what?
There’ll be plenty of time to work in all those details that seemed so important while you were throat-clearing that would have cost you a sale. For now, your job is to start with a bang.
Too many characters introduced too quickly
I’m usually wary of generalizations or hard and fast rules, but almost any time I see more than three characters within the first few pages, my eyes start to swim. If I feel like I need a program to keep track of the players, I quickly lose interest.
Your reader is trying to comprehend the story, and if you ask him to start cataloguing a cast of characters right away, you risk losing him. Keep things simple till the story has taken shape.
Point of View violations
Maintain a single Point of View (POV) for every scene. Violate that cardinal rule and you expose yourself as an amateur right out of the gate. Beginners often defend themselves against this criticism by citing classics by famous authors or citing J.K. Rowling, the exception who proves the rule.
Times change. Readers’ tastes evolve. This is the rule for today, and it’s true of what sells.
Clichés, and not just words and phrases
There are also clichéd situations, like starting your story with the main character waking to an alarm clock, a character describing herself while looking in a full-length mirror, future love interests literally bumping into each other upon first meeting, etc.
Avoid, too, beginning with an evocative, dramatic scene, and surprise, surprise, the main character wakes up to discover it’s all been a dream. There’s nothing wrong with dreams, but having them come as surprises has been used to death and takes all the air from the balloon of your story.
It’s also a cliché to have your main character feel his heart pound, race, thud, or hammer; and then he gasps, sucks wind, his breath comes short… If you describe the scene properly, your reader should experience all that and you shouldn’t have to say your character did. Put your character into a rough enough situation, and the reader will know what he’s feeling without having to be told—and hopefully he’ll share his distress.
Simply bad writing:
Written-ese
This is what I call that special language we all tend to use when we forget to Just Say It.
On-the-nose writing
Hollywood screenwriters coined this term for prose that exactly mirrors real life but fails to advance your plot. There’s nothing wrong with the words themselves, except that they could be synopsized to save the reader’s time and patience. A perfect example is replacing all the hi’s and hello’s and how are you’s that precede meaningful dialogue with something like: “After trading pleasantries, Jim asked Fred if he’d heard about what had happened to Tricia. ‘No, what?’”
Passive voice
Avoid state-of-being verbs. Change sentences like “There was a man standing…” to “A man stood…”
Needless words
The most famous rule in the bible of writing hints, The Elements of Style, is “Omit Needless Words,” which follows its own advice. This should be the hallmark of every writer.
Example: The administrative assistant ushered me through the open door into the CEO’s office, and I sat down in a chair across from his big, wood desk.
Edit: The administrative assistant ushered me through the open door into the CEO’s office, and I sat down in a chair across from his big, wood desk.
Obviously, there would be a door. And even more obviously, it would be open. If I sat, I would sit “down,” and naturally it would be in a chair. Because I’m seeing the CEO, a description of his desk would be notable only if it weren’t big or wood.
Result: The administrative assistant ushered me into the CEO’s office, and I sat across from his desk.

            <Title>Sudden Awakening</Title>
            <Text>As time passed, the group’s bonds grew and strengthened, as they continued to learn more of each other’s abilities. Their days were spent in a mix of individual pursuits and working together to tackle the occasional tasks the expedition members asked of them. Many evenings, they would spend time sparring with one another to hone their combat skills.
Then, one night, Kamery was jolted awake by Raynn’s pained cry fracturing the stillness. Instantly alert, she crouched, daggers in hand, scanning for danger in the dim light of the banked fire. The warrior was still asleep on her bedroll, although her face was drawn and pale in the amber glow. She cried out again, waking herself this time; her eyes were dark and haunted as she sat up.
Raynn’s cries had woken the others too, and they slowly stirred. Beside the warrior, Bryna blinked sleepily, her burgundy hair tousled around her shoulders. It was odd seeing the mage without her hat, Kamery noted offhandedly, as she deftly resheathed her daggers and made her way over to Raynn’s side of the sleeping area.
Carolyn joined her a moment later, circling around to kneel by Raynn’s shoulder, as Kamery crouched beside one plate-clad knee. Raynn, they had learned, was comfortable sleeping in full plate armor; more comfortable than taking it off, it seemed. On the warrior’s other side, Bryna was sitting up, and Elthas was kneeling across from Kamery.
Raynn became aware of them, and her face regained some color, flushing in embarrassment. Carolyn laid a gentle hand on the warrior’s shoulder.
“What happened?” the priestess asked softly.
“Nightmare,” the warrior answered shortly. Her left hand rubbed absently at her side and Kamery noticed.
“An old injury?” the rogue asked, curious but keeping her tone neutral.</Text>

- Buys a horse at some point
- She finally arrives in Theramore, and furthers her studies with Jaina Proudmoore.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The shimmering kaleidescope of sensations faded once more, and Bryna sighed at the too-familiar sight of the Mage Tower in Stormwind. Humans and Gnomes sat studiously reading from the magical tomes or stood in small groups discussing theories of spell-casting. She felt like she could recite the debates by heart. Ley lines and focal points, matrices and crossing power streams.
Over the past few weeks, since parting with Kamery, she had exhausted her repertoire of portal knowledge in her search for knowledge. Mathias Shaw had been suspicious that the returned King had lost all memory of his abduction, and she had wondered if the amnesia could have been magically induced.
Of course, if Shaw’s suspicions were valid, she had no way of knowing who had actually enacted the spell, so she couldn’t just go around asking powerful mages if they knew how to wipe a King’s memory. Instead, she had turned to what she did best—traveling the world for research.
Bryna decided that the portal mages lacked imagination, or the world lacked suitable portal conduits. She wasn’t sure which, but there was such a limited number of locations one could visit.
She had, to her delight, found one new one, or rather, rediscovered an old one. She smiled at the memory.
Standing in front of a half-empty bookshelf, Bryna flipped through a dusty tome with interest. Much of the library here was in disarray, but this particular book had caught her eye. ‘Spells of Dalaran’ promised to be an interesting read.
At her feet, a small black cat batted at her boot in annoyance. She pushed it away with her toe, gently, careful not to disrupt the polymorph spell. It was such a fragile spell, and she didn’t need the librarian laying about her with his cudgel again.
She sighed, turning another page. The members of the Scarlet Crusade were fanatical, when all she wanted to do was read a few books. She had heard a rumor about this library, tucked away in the Scourge-forsaken Tirisfal Glades, on a recent visit to Darnassus, and had decided to see it for herself.
Another page flipped, another already-known spell disappearing to her sight. The book was proving to be a disappointment. Her eyes scanned the next page, and then she saw it. ‘Teleport: Dalaran’. Excitement swept through her at the thought of a new spell, and a teleportation spell at that!
The cat meowed, and Bryna distractedly recast the polymorph spell, her eyes drinking in the words of the spell, committing it to memory. The transformation wouldn’t hold for long this time, she knew, so setting the book back on its shelf—that should mollify the zealous librarian somewhat, she hoped—she pulled the arcane energies around herself, enacting the new spell, wondering where exactly she would end up.
The ancient city of Dalaran was well-known to all mages. Once the seat of power of the Kirin Tor, it had come under attack in the wars against the Legion, and supposedly been destroyed. Supposedly—nobody had witnessed the destruction and returned to tell of it, so rumors abounded. The magical prowess of the Kirin Tor had been unmatched, leading to no end of stories of their survival.
A thrill shivered up Bryna’s spine at the thought of studying with the mages of the Kirin Tor. As the swirling teleportation magic surrounded her, she hoped at least some of the rumors were true.
Unfortunately, if they were, this spell wouldn’t help her—she felt herself falling almost as soon as she materialized. Luckily, she was always prepared with a slow-fall spell, and she whispered the word quickly.
As Bryna drifted down to the ground, she looked around, getting her bearings. She wasn’t familiar with her surroundings. Rolling hills covered with lush grass extended in all directions, with copses of pine trees scattered across the landscape. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw the sparkle of a lake in the distance to the northwest. She decided that this could easily be the Hillsbrad Foothills, where Dalaran had once been located. There was no shining city here though, only a massive crater in the ground.
Looking down, she inspected the crater. Rough stone edges, with jumbled boulders scattered about. With a frown, she noticed that the bottom of the crater was swarming with zombies. The mindless undead noticed her as she drifted closer, and she sighed, pulling her frost spells to mind. Zombies were so predictable.
A shield of frost surrounded her as she touched down lightly. She calmly allowed the swarm of zombies to approach a little closer, then, as their outstretched arms were almost touching her, she cast a ring of frost, freezing them in place. A quick teleport to open the distance again, and she turned and summoned a blizzard on top of them. Pelted by ice and snow, the zombies crumpled quickly. Frost spells were so useful, she thought, smiling in satisfaction.
Looking around at the crumbled ground, Bryna decided that there was nothing useful left here, and she could see more zombies ambling around in the distance. “A book or something would have been nice,” she grumbled aloud. The zombies ignored her. With a grimace, she enacted the spell that would take her back to Stormwind.
Looking around the well-known surroundings, Bryna felt the familiar frustration with familiarity growing stronger. New places were always fun, despite the undead. But now the crater of Dalaran wasn’t new anymore, so she was out of options again. Her eyes scanning the shelves that lined the room, she realized that she had already read all of the books here, several times for most of them.
There was one place though, where she hadn’t read everything yet. And where there was a former Kirin Tor arch-mage of impressive power and experience to learn from. Thinking of reading everything reminded her of her brief conversation with Shaw, the last time she had been in Stormwind. Matching wits had been an entertaining way to pass the time while Kamery had been spending some time with her rogue trainer, learning new ways to stab people.
Hopefully Jaina wouldn’t mind a visitor, and perhaps, she would know something about magically induced memory loss. Pulling on the teleportation magic one more time, Bryna disappeared as quickly as she had arrived.</Text>

            <Title>The Cheese Shop</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Report back to Trias</Synopsis>
            <Text>Carolyn watched quietly as Kamery spoke to Elling Trias in hushed tones. The cheese shop master nodded, unsurprised, accepting the news of an assassination within the city with as much reaction as he might give to a delivery of Alterac Swiss. Carolyn looked around the upper floor of the shop, taking in the rest of their small group in the dimly lit area.
Bryna lounged against one wall, her eyes shielded by her red hat. Her plain wooden quarterstaff leaned against the wall beside her; adorned with nothing but a simple leather grip, the staff almost blended into the rough wooden walls. Like the rest of Bryna’s simple linen outfit, it was all an illusion, of course. Carolyn inwardly shook her head. If she hadn’t seen the mage in battle herself, she would never have believed that the woman was the slightest bit dangerous.
Raynn, on the other hand, exuded an unmistakable air of danger. Her hands flexed slowly in their gauntlets, still getting used to the stiff new leather and iron. Her shield was slung on her back and her sword was sheathed at her side, but Carolyn knew that both would be ready in an instant if necessary. It was a comforting thought.
Elthas, as usual, prowled around the perimeter of the group in his feline form, with sleek black fur rippling over powerful muscles. Curved runes of paler fur marked his shoulders, echoing the tattoos that she knew adorned his Kaldorei form. He stopped to investigate a hole low on the wall, earning a sharp glance from the cheese master.
“No mice, I hope,” Trias’s tone was serious. This, it seemed, was more important than the situation with the Defias. Bryna’s full lips curved with amusement beneath the brim of her hat.
Elthas’s whiskers twitched and he shook his head. He sat back on his haunches for a moment, his intelligent golden eyes surveying the group. Carolyn wondered if he was thinking along the same lines that she was, about how well their little group had come together in just a few short days. Given the young druid’s nature, it was just as likely he was simply daydreaming about chasing mice.
“Good.” Trias nodded in satisfaction. “You’ve all done well. Let Shaw know. And here, take this report to the King.” He held out a sheaf of papers, wrapped securely in twine and sealed with red wax. “It details everything we’ve learned about Lescovar.” He paused for a moment. “It’s probably best if you don’t mention your role here.”
Carolyn’s eyes widened at the mention of the King. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed that even Bryna stood a bit straighter. An audience with the King of Stormwind, the High King of the Alliance? The idea was dizzying. Looking at her sister, Carolyn saw her own expression mirrored in identical grey eyes and she knew that even Kamery was intimidated by the idea.
Raynn, however, seemed unmoved as she reached forward and took the papers smoothly. Her amber eyes found Kamery’s. “You’ll talk to Shaw?” She almost seemed relieved to have to report to the King rather than Shaw.
Amusement danced in Kamery’s eyes and Carolyn knew that her sister had seen the warrior’s discomfort too. Having met the spy-master a few times during Kamery’s early training, Carolyn had found him friendly enough, if a bit distant. Kamery had told her that Raynn found him disconcerting though, which was unfortunate, since Shaw was intrigued by the warrior’s mysterious past.
The bell on the shop door downstairs jingled, heralding the arrival of another customer. The low murmur of voices drifted up to the group on the upper floor, as Trias’s wife greeted the newcomer. Trias glanced wistfully at the stairs. “I think we’re done here.” His voice held a note of hope, as he looked around the group once more to see if there were any last issues.
Kamery nodded. “Thank you.” She glanced at the stairs, a question in her grey eyes.
Trias gestured for them to follow as he started down the stairs, raising his voice as he descended. “I hope you all enjoyed the tasting. Freshest cheeses in Stormwind!” The aromas on the main floor of the shop gave weight to his words, the sharp smell of Redridge Roquefort mixing with the mellow Stormwind Brie.
The less pleasing smells of the city intruded as Trias opened the shop door for them, causing the bell to jingle merrily again. “Come back again soon!” In a voice only they could hear, he added, “to buy cheese!”
Raynn chuckled, relaxing as the shop door closed behind the cheese master. Carolyn wondered what it was in her past that had her so on edge around the spy-masters. With a nod to the others, the enigmatic warrior turned and left to fulfill her task.</Text>

            <Title>The Cottage</Title>
            <Text>In the morning, they ate another cold breakfast, before breaking camp and crossing through the hills and into Elwynn Forest. Once more, they avoided the main road, instead skirting along the foothills along the northern edge of the forest.
Raynn quite enjoyed that the detours had the added advantage of giving her and Varian plenty of aggressive wildlife and semi-sentient foes to engage with. Carolyn seemed to agree, as the less challenging foes allowed her to wade into the melee with unbridled enthusiasm, much to Varian’s amusement.
Skirting around the village of Goldshire, they turned northward, following Kamery through the peaceful forest towards an abandoned dwelling at the edge of a small lake. Raynn looked around the forest, drinking in the sight of the dappled sunshine through the green leaves of the trees and the fresh scent of the thick grass. A wolf howled in the distance, but the sound was mournful rather than threatening.
The deserted cottage was just a single room at the ground level. The wall to the left of the door was dominated by a large stone hearth, now cold and empty with the cooking apparatus long-since removed. Across from the hearth, to the right of the door, a steep staircase led upwards to sleeping areas in the loft above.
Looking around the plain homestead, Raynn felt a sense of solidarity with Kamery and Carolyn. Her own upbringing had been similar— simple but loving, yet ended with tragedy.
Two narrow windows looked out on either side of the front door, and two more larger ones would allow light in on the opposite wall. However, drawn curtains covered all four windows now; someone wanted privacy for this meeting.
A large, round table stood in the middle of the room, with four chairs around it. Although the homemade wooden furniture was simple, it was well-made and worn smooth with frequent use. A lantern burned on the tabletop, silent notification that they were not the first ones to arrive.
“Welcome home, Your Majesty.” Mathias Shaw stepped out of the shadows at the back of the room and bowed to Varian. He turned to Elthas, who had entered last. “Please, close the door. We have much to discuss.”
As the door closed, a magical light flared to life near the ceiling, illuminating the dim room. Footsteps on the staircase announced the presence of another. At the sound, Raynn looked over and was pleasantly surprised to see Jaina Proudmoore descending the staircase. Although Jaina smiled briefly at Raynn and Bryna, her attention was on Varian and her face was tense.
Varian nodded a greeting to the arch-mage, as she spoke. “I have found out much since our last meeting. I believe I have the answers we seek.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Bryna helps Carolyn repair her robe; Kamery and Carolyn reconnect while Kamery makes potions.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kamery and Raynn had almost finished their preparations. Kamery’s map was incomplete, ending where she had been forced to turn back. Carolyn could hear the self-castigation in her sister’s voice as she concluded, “I couldn’t get any further. It looked like there was some sort of door ahead. I have no idea how far down these mines go.”
Carolyn smiled softly at her sister, knowing that Kamery would read the reassurance in her eyes, and the rogue’s leather-clad shoulders relaxed slightly.
“You’re up for this?” Raynn’s question was blunt. With a small start, Carolyn realized that it was directed at her, feeling the warrior’s dark amber eyes bore into her widening ones.
“Of course.” Carolyn grinned suddenly. “Kam said that you’re good at drawing all the attention. As long as she’s right”—she gave her sister a mischievous glance—“we’ll be fine.”
Kamery’s eyes narrowed over her black bandanna. Raynn’s head jerked up and down once, quickly, apparently satisfied. “We should get some rest then, and head out in the morning.” The warrior glanced questioningly around the group.
The others nodded and, with a clatter of chairs scraping against the floor, they all rose. Carolyn watched Elthas straightening his wide shoulders. His dark blue hair almost brushed against the wide beams of dark wood crossing the ceiling. Obviously, the inn hadn’t been built with Kaldorei in mind. Luckily for Elthas, he was a druid, and he shifted quickly into his feline form.
He hadn’t spoken much during the planning meeting, but he had been attentive and had studied Kamery’s map closely. Carolyn knew that his feline form’s vision was different, and he could see ink on paper better in his Kaldorei form. He nudged her hand, and she stroked the soft fur of his head, eliciting a rumbling purr. His energy returning, he bounded up the stairs to his room above.
Bryna was the last to stand, her movements slow and lethargic. Her red hat shaded her eyes, but Carolyn could feel the weight of the mage’s gaze. It seemed focused on her arm, and Carolyn glanced down at her torn sleeve. She tugged the ragged edges together, trying to hide them.
“Let’s get that fixed,” Bryna offered. “I’ve cast a seam or two in my day.”
Carolyn smiled as she responded, “I can do it myself.” At Bryna’s lazy shrug, she winced, and quickly added, “I wouldn’t mind help though. My kit is upstairs.”
As she followed Bryna up the wide wooden stairs to their rooms, Carolyn studied the mage’s clothing. It appeared simple, but she was learning to imbue cloth with magic herself, and recognized some familiar details—and noticed a few unfamiliar ones.
As they reached the second floor landing, the clinking of glasses and casual chatter from the common room faded away. Approaching the room that she and Kamery were sharing, Carolyn glimpsed her sister inside, digging through the variety of dried herbs and powders that she always carried with her.
Bryna noticed the same thing, and suggested, “Let’s use my kit.” Carolyn nodded in agreement and followed Bryna down the narrow, well-lit hallway to the mage’s room.
As Bryna retrieved her sewing kit, Carolyn pulled off her robe. It was strange wearing just a lightweight linen shirt and leggings, and her legs curled protectively underneath her as she settled on the soft bed. Bryna sat opposite her, the robe spread out on the faded blue patchwork quilt between them.
Bryna’s sewing kit was so much more extensive than her own, filled not only with the accustomed threads and scraps of fabric, but also an array of colorful sparkling dusts, crystals, and gems. Carolyn’s eyes darted from one strange reagent to another.
“For enchanting too,” Bryna revealed, as she reached for a spool of white thread and a golden needle. “This won’t be pretty, but it’ll at least keep the draft out.”
Carolyn fidgeted with the robe, twisting the folds to reveal other mends and patches. She wasn’t entirely sure, but she thought she felt Bryna recoil slightly, before the mage caught herself. Curious, Carolyn asked, “Where did you learn to sew?”
Bryna smiled and, with obvious pride in her voice, answered, “My parents own a shop in Stormwind. I grew up doing this.”
Carolyn’s eyes widened. “I’d appreciate any tips then!”
Bryna grinned roguishly, momentarily reminding Carolyn of Kamery. “Watch and learn.” She threaded the needle with practiced ease.
Carolyn obeyed readily, watching the flashing needle with rapt attention. The mage’s stitches were neat and tidy, each one winding an enchantment into the cloth to strengthen it.
Bryna glanced up, her eyes appraising Carolyn. “How’s your endurance spell-casting? Or do you want more power?” She tilted her head thoughtfully. “We may face some rough fights ahead, if these Defias are as stubborn as we’ve heard.”
Carolyn nodded as she answered, “I’m good with pacing myself. Power might be nice. Raynn is confident, but—” She broke off, not wanting to criticize their newest member, and prospective protector.
Bryna had no such compunctions. “Half mail, and worn out at that. You’ll have your hands full.”
Carolyn stiffened. “I can manage. I’ve been in combat before.”
Finished with her repairs, Bryna shook out the robe, holding it up as she smirked. “Yes, I can see.” Her head was up though, and Carolyn could see her dark eyes dancing with amusement, not malice.
Snatching up her robe, Carolyn quickly slipped it over her head, allowing the heavy folds to embrace her body once more. She felt the extra magical power coursing through her, and she gave Bryna an appreciative look. “Thank you. We should get some sleep now. Morning will come quickly.”
Bryna nodded, and Carolyn headed back to her shared room, hoping that Kamery had finished with the herbs. While she understood the value of noxious concoctions that her sister used to coat her weapons, she couldn’t stand the stench.
Kamery was still hard at work, her herbs spread out on the small wooden table on one side of the room, but the familiar odors were not there. Instead, the air was filled with a pungent, yet refreshing, aroma. Carolyn crossed to the table, breathing deeply of the unfamiliar scents. “New recipes?” How much had her sister learned in their year apart? How much had she learned herself that Kamery didn’t know yet?
Looking up, Kamery’s grey eyes were dark in the flickering light of the lamp. “Alchemy.” Her bandanna was down for once, so Carolyn could see her smile. She gestured to the array of potions on the table, vials filled with brightly colored liquids. “I thought they might be useful.”
Carolyn nodded, impressed. She had known of Kamery’s knack for finding useful herbs, an instinct that she had had since childhood, but combining them into beneficial potions was a new skill.
Kamery held up a gleaming blue potion. “This will help if you run out of mana.” She spoke the word easily, but her tone indicated that she was mystified as to how the wellspring of magical power worked. A wave of her hand indicated a group of red potions on the table. “These are mostly for Raynn. Healing.” She glanced up at Carolyn guilty. “Not that I doubt you. Just in case.”
Carolyn’s lips curved upwards, her eyes sparkling. “Always good to be prepared. Besides, I might be too busy hitting things!”
Kamery’s light laugh was refreshing, and Carolyn found herself joining in, as she watched her sister crush and mix herbs. With deft, precise movements, she added specific amounts to several vials, swirling each as she did. After a moment, the mixtures glowed briefly, and turned vibrant yellow.
“I’ve missed you,” Carolyn admitted, her throat tight. Kamery had pushed her to follow her dreams to Darnassus, but had it been too soon after their parents’ death? Carolyn studied her sister, wondering what else the past year had changed for her. Kamery had always been so independent, until her recent request for aid.
Kamery paused and looked up, her eyes shining as they met Carolyn’s. “Me too,” the rogue confessed. Stepping around the table, she hugged her sister, and the two held each other close for a moment.
“Morning comes too quickly.” Kamery reluctantly broke the embrace. She gathered up her alchemy materials, carefully stowing the finished vials in several soft leather pouches. The herbs and powders went away in their own sleeves and pouches, and everything was packed neatly into her magical backpack.
Morning comes too quickly indeed, Carolyn thought, as she settled into bed, listening to her sister’s familiar, even breathing across the room.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Kam and El infiltrate LBRS to get the gemstones for the Seal of Ascension</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Let us try first,” Kamery said, also thinking back to finding Ironfoe. “Perhaps we can do this without bringing the entire city down on us.”
Although she momentarily looked as impatient and eager for combat as Varian once had, Raynn nodded shortly. The warrior’s nerves had been on edge facing the Blackrock Orcs on their way through the outer garrison. Kamery knew that Raynn found peace in the immediacy of combat.
The rogue smiled behind her bandanna. “If one has the gemstone on them, we may need your sword,” she offered, eliciting a chuckle from the warrior.
With a faint smile, Vaelan pulled a rolled up parchment from a pocket, offering, “This may help.” He unrolled it, revealing a carefully annotated map of the multi-level Orcish city. Studying the map, Kamery realized that more than just Orcs lived in the lower reaches; they would be facing Ogres, Trolls, and Dragonspawn as well.
Vaelan had marked the locations of the various clans that occupied the city, and now he pointed out the abodes of the three who possessed the gemstones. Elthas had moved closer to study the map also, and after a few moments to commit the lines to memory, they were ready.
After applying poisons to her daggers, Kamery slipped into the shadows, with Elthas shifting into panther form to join her, and they set off towards the first location, the inner chamber of War Master Voone of the Smolderthorn Trolls.
The initial squared hallway at the entrance led quickly to a rougher pathway leading down. Stone flagstones covered the floor, but in places it had buckled and ridges of bare stone cut across their path. Braziers supported on four-legged stands were scattered along the path, lighting their way. Although the air was still and stale, it didn’t feel as oppressive as the depths had; the temperature was more moderate also.
To their left, the stone wall rose up unevenly, but to the right, it dropped off precipitously, and Kamery could see a river of magma far below. Across the chasm, she could see the straight-edged walls of the other parts of the city, extending all the way down almost to the level of the magma, with walkways and bridges connecting them on various levels. The walls were built from massive blocks of stone, with embossed steel girders reinforcing the corners and edges.
The walkway they were on now was occupied by groups of dark-skinned Orcs, patrolling up and down, or stopping to talk while looking out over the city. Weaving their way past the members of the Dark Horde, Kamery and Elthas crossed a rope bridge, turned to the right, then crossed another bridge. They moved slowly to prevent their weight from causing the bridges to sway or the wooden slats to creak beneath them.
As they reached the solid stone to the far side, Kamery breathed a sigh of relief. The pair turned right again. A squad of Orcs, resting on hides beneath a canopy in the corner, noticed nothing as they slipped past silently. Before long, they reached the crevice in the floor that Vaelan had indicated as a shortcut to the lower levels. Ignoring the plank bridge that crossed it, they dropped down lightly.
Slipping past several Trolls, they reached the side chamber where War Master Voone lived. The Troll was alone, so Kamery silently drew her dagger, and with the hilt, rendered him unconscious.
Swiftly, they searched the chamber. The gemstones were magical, and Elthas was able to pick up the scent, in the War Master’s pocket. Carefully, Kamery retrieved the glowing, orange stone without rousing the Troll, and the pair slipped back the way they had come.
From Voone’s chambers in the lowest levels of the city, they followed a winding, climbing path up to the area occupied by the Ogres. Unlike the intermingling Orcs and Trolls, the Ogres seemed to keep to themselves.
Highlord Omokk was surrounded by guards, but fortunately, his sparkling, white gemstone was hidden in a cache at the rear of the chamber, and Kamery was able to retrieve it without alerting the Ogres, who seemed occupied by a rousing game of dice.
Making their way cautiously past crevices filled with skittering scorpids, Kamery and Elthas reached the office of the third gemstone warden—Quartermaster Zigris of the Bloodaxe Legion of Orcs.
Elthas peered around the chamber cautiously, but shook his head; he couldn’t sense the gemstone. Kamery moved up to incapacitate the Quartermaster, hoping to search his pockets more thoroughly, but he was more alert than most Orcs, and spotted her, swinging his heavy mace at her.
Caught by surprise, Kamery caught the blow with her upraised left arm, feeling the bone crack; the arm fell to her side with a cold numbness. Adrenaline surged through her, fueling her desperate determination. With her right hand, she drew her dagger, slashing at the Orc’s midsection. He fell back, and her dagger only scored his leather vest.
Rejuvenating healing filled her, as Elthas quickly shifted out of feline form; almost immediately, he dropped back to all fours—not as a panther, but as a bear. With a roar, he drew Zigris’s attention.
As her arm mended, Kamery drew her second dagger with her left hand, and applied both daggers with deadly effect to the Orc’s exposed back. She heard the thud as Zigris’s weapon landed on Elthas’s shoulder, but the bear only roared in anger, swiping at the Orc with his paw.
The Orc was a canny fighter, and after Kamery’s first strike, he turned, backing into a corner, so she could no longer strike him from behind. Between her and Elthas though, he couldn’t block or parry all of their strikes. Her daggers once more found an opening, slicing open his bare upper arm. 
The wound wasn’t particularly incapacitating, but it was enough for her poisons to flow through his blood. Weakened, the Orc fell under Elthas’s next swipe. Kamery finished him off with her daggers.
Regrouping, she turned to Elthas. His head was bowed, his breath rough and strained. Blood matted the grey-brown fur of his shoulder, just above the tattooed runes. Kneeling beside him, her heart still racing, Kamery fumbled in her pack for a bandage, but he shifted back to Kaldorei form, drawing nature magic once more. Before she could stand, he sat down facing her, his face still drawn as the slow healing began its work.
The druid drew in several more breaths, as his bleeding shoulder began to mend, then he looked at her and grinned. “Next time, maybe we should bring Raynn and Caro.”
Kamery laughed, relaxing, glad to see him once more his cheerful self.
“I couldn’t sense the gemstone before. Does he have it?” Elthas brought her attention back to their mission. He stood, the healing almost complete, and shifted back to feline form. Examining the body, he shook his head. “Not here?” The Kaldorei voice coming from the panther’s throat sounded confused.
Kamery looked around the room. It was filled with boxes and crates, and she knew that sometimes containers could be shielded to hide powerful magical artifacts. She began opening what she could.
A chest in the corner was locked, so she pulled out her lock-picks. Working carefully, she felt around inside the lock. There was a tripwire, but she could disable it, and finally the lock clicked open. Lifting the lid of the chest, she revealed the final, gleaming, red gemstone.
Slipping the gem into her pocket with the other two, she and Elthas returned to the others.</Text>

            <Title>Ashenvale Patrol</Title>
            <Text>The Ashenvale forest enveloped Raynn and her orc companions as they ventured on their routine patrol near the road to Felwood. The familiar sounds of the wilderness accompanied their footsteps, creating a rhythm that echoed the tranquility of their surroundings.
Abruptly, the peaceful atmosphere shattered as a malevolent force materialized. Tichondrius, the dreadlord, emerged with a calculated ambush, catching the orcs off guard. In the ensuing chaos, Raynn, though trained, found herself in her first real combat situation.
Sword clashed against demonic spear as Raynn fought valiantly, but Tichondrius's cunning proved overwhelming. In a swift, cruel motion, the dreadlord's weapon found its mark, impaling Raynn and leaving her defenseless against a tree.
As Tichondrius reveled in his sadistic triumph, the orcs, now scattered by the demonic assault, succumbed to the relentless onslaught. Death echoed through the once serene forest as Tichondrius mercilessly dispatched each member of the patrol.
Amidst the carnage, a shadowy figure emerged. Illidan Stormrage, his presence almost otherworldly, confronted Tichondrius with a deadly dance of blades. The clash between the demonic and the elven was fierce, culminating in Illidan's triumph over the dreadlord.
With the battleground now hushed, Illidan turned his attention to the wounded Raynn. Her form, still impaled by Tichondrius's weapon, bore the scars of her first taste of true battle. Illidan, his enigmatic nature momentarily softened, tended to Raynn's wounds, pondering the fate of this human caught in the crossfire of demonic machinations.</Text>

            <Text>One hand resting comfortingly on Carolyn’s shoulder, Bryna watched as Jaina once more enveloped the subdued Hendel in magical chains. Distractedly, she added the spell to her mental list of spells that she needed to learn someday. That list, she noted wryly, was growing longer every day, especially on days spent with Jaina Proudmoore. Perhaps it was time to heed the familiar restlessness once again.
“We will continue to interrogate him, to see if we can learn anything more,” Jaina said wearily. “I’m afraid he hasn’t helped us much. We already know that the King’s ship disappeared.”
With a wave of her hand, Hendel disappeared, teleported back to whatever prison her tower housed. Jaina’s face softened as she came around to face Carolyn. “Thank you. You saved us much time.”
Carolyn nodded, her face still a bit drawn, but starting to relax now. Bryna wondered if it was the nature of Shadow magic, or the priestess’s own nature, that made it so taxing for her to use. She decided it must be the latter, or priests would never use such spells. Carolyn was so good at heart, it made sense that she was uncomfortable with the darkness.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Elthas flashback to meeting Carolyn as he enters the Park</Synopsis>
            <Text>As he left the two Humans to find a new robe for Carolyn, Elthas thought back on his first meeting with the indomitable priestess.
Elthas stalked silently through the purplish-green undergrowth of Teldrassil, his black fur blending in to the shadows. In a clearing up ahead, he could hear the unruly sprites that he had been asked to help subdue. They sounded more agitated than he had expected.
A rustle in the bushes behind him caught his attention and he stopped, turning around to see a female Human striding through the forest that surrounded Darnassus. A Human?! The thought set him back on his haunches, and he forgot to stay in the shadows.
Shorter than a Kaldorei, although still much taller than his feline form, the Human smelled faintly of the herbs he associated with the Temple of Elune. In her hand, she carried a sturdy staff of white wood, etched with holy symbols, and she was wearing the white robes he associated with priestesses. Her hair, swept up into a neat swirl at the back of her head, was golden blonde, a shade that stood out in comparison to the darker colors of his people—certainly brighter than his own dark blue hair.
She noticed him and came to a halt, studying him with a growing smile.
“Are you a druid?” she asked, her voice shaking slightly.
Thinking that he had scared her, Elthas shifted out of form. It was a mistake—he towered over the slight figure. Her eyes were wide as she took a step back, taking him in. He felt his wide shoulders drop and curl inward, trying to not be so intimidating.
Her smile hadn’t faltered though. “You are a druid!” There was unmistakable excitement in her voice now. She took another step back, this time not for distance, but so that she could hop up onto a root that twisted behind her. Now she was almost the same height as he was. Elthas felt himself smiling in response as he nodded.
“You’re a priestess?” he asked, still trying to figure out what a Human was doing in the wilds of Teldrassil. Humans were not uncommon in Darnassus, but they mostly stayed around the central trunk of the World Tree.
The Human nodded, and introduced herself. “Carolyn Wilson, from Stormwind.” Her small nose wrinkled a little at that. He wondered what it was about the Human city that she found distasteful. He hadn’t been outside of Teldrassil, and couldn’t wait to explore the world.
“Elthas,” he replied, adding unnecessarily, “from Darnassus.” He cringed inwardly, but she laughed, a delightfully musical sound. Tilting his head to one side, he gave in to his curiosity. “What are you doing out here?”
If anything, her smile grew, as she gestured to the grove ahead. “Hunting sprites. You?”
Baffled, Elthas nodded. “As am I.”
Carolyn’s eyes lit up. “Can we go together?” She frowned briefly. “I don’t need help! I just want to see a druid fighting!”
Elthas chuckled at her eagerness. He could fight alone too, but he enjoyed the company of others, and this Human was refreshingly enthusiastic. “Why not.” He dropped back into feline form, and her smile returned full force.
He resumed his slow stalk through the undergrowth, but Carolyn had no such caution. She ran ahead to the edge of the grove, a shimmering golden shield of holy power wrapping around her as she moved.
Two of the sprites noticed her, converging on her from two sides, and to Elthas’s absolute surprise, she began swinging her staff at them. Once his shock faded, he realized that she was actually quite adept with the weapon, landing blows that dispatched the farther sprite in short order. The other, just to his left, continued to cast its wild thorn magic at her though, and her shield shattered.
Deciding that this was his cue, Elthas shook of his bemused stupor and pounced, his claws raking at the unsuspecting sprite from behind. Carolyn’s staff landed another blow, and between that and his attacks, the sprite fell.
He glanced up to see her smiling in delight. He was about to shift again to speak to her, when a sharp pain hit him in the side. A third sprite off to his right had taken notice of them. Grimacing in pain, Elthas turned, noticing that Carolyn’s delight had given way to a look of grim determination.
A surge of healing power flowed through him, mending the wound in his side, as he leaped at the sprite, claws extended in an extension of his self. Carolyn’s staff joined the fray to his left, and the sprite was finished quickly. Three sprites in short order. They made a good team, he thought.
Carolyn crouched before him, her eyes shining, but with a faint overlay of concern. “Are you alright?” she asked.
Elthas nodded. He didn’t shift this time, but pushed his voice out through the panther’s throat. “Thank you for the healing.”
Carolyn fell back in shock, and he realized that she probably didn’t know much about druids. Shifting then, he apologetically helped her to her feet.
She brushed off his apology, her eyes still bright, saying, “I want to know everything you can do!”
She had indeed learned everything that he could do, Elthas reflected as he loped across the white stone bridge to the Stormwind Park. She had even learned a holy spell of her own that was similar to his own healing spells, with their quick cast and slow action. He grinned, remembering her delight when he had told her “Now you can heal like a druid.”
The fresh scent of grass and sea air greeted him as he entered the Park. Elthas slowed his pace, drinking in the surroundings. Neatly trimmed hedges separated the Park from the canal-side pathway that surrounded it, setting it apart from the rest of the city. Smooth, carefully tended, grass extended out in front of him. In the center of the lawn stood a small shimmering fountain, reminiscent of Darnassus. He hoped that the druids here could help him; it was time to learn something new to show Carolyn.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Raynn opens up about her past</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn’s eyes burned with unfamiliar moisture, but her friends’ warmth surrounded her, reassuring her. Slowly, haltingly, through her tight throat, the warrior revealed the painful tapestry of her past. They listened quietly, acceptingly, with few interruptions as she acknowledged what they had already somewhat guessed—that she had grown up in Lordaeron, and traveled to Kalimdor with the Orcish Horde.
The warmth of Carolyn’s hand on her shoulder, and Elthas’s firm grip on her hands steadied her, as she told them about her parents’ deaths at the hands of angry and frightened Humans at an internment camp. Her mother had been studying the Orcs; the family had been caught in the middle when Thrall’s army had arrived to liberate the Orcish prisoners.
They listened without judgment as she told them how Grom and Thrall had found her, and delivered her to safety with the Dwarves of Dun Modr. At the mention of Grom’s name, she felt Elthas’s hands tighten involuntarily on hers, but the druid gave her an apologetic look and continued listening as she explained that she had known Grom as a mentor and protector, not the demon-driven force of destruction he had been to the Kaldorei.
Grom had been the first to find her dying father, while she had watched from hiding, terrified. Her father had accepted Grom’s offer of a swift death, but only after making the fierce Orc promise to care for his daughter. Even to the end, Grom had considered that a blood oath—an unbreakable bond between them.
Bryna nodded thoughtfully as Raynn admitted to misdirecting the Human army that would have caught the Orcs before they could safely depart from Southshore, and how Thrall and Grom had taken her with them to protect her from reprisal. The mage had already deduced that she had traveled to Kalimdor with the Orcs, Raynn knew from Bryna’s earlier questioning, thankfully cut off at the time by Kamery.
Carolyn’s arms surrounded Raynn as she told them what she knew about her injury; she had been with an Orcish patrol in Ashenvale when they had been beset by a demon and she had been incapacitated. She had passed out from the wound, and woken weeks later, in Jaina’s camp at Stonetalon Peak. Still uncertain herself about her rescuer, she omitted mention of the shadowy figure who had dispatched the demon before it could finish her off.
The judgment she had feared didn’t come. She had divulged even more than Jaina knew, her words a stream of memory that once started, she hadn’t been able to stop, but they accepted her. Raynn felt tears welling in her eyes, but it was, as Elthas had said, cleansing.
They had fallen into an exhausted, but peaceful, sleep not long after. When they awoke, there were a few lingering questions, which Raynn answered honestly, if occasionally hesitantly. She was still getting used to being this vulnerable, and the others were willing to give her time, for the wound Elthas had mentioned to begin to heal.</Text>

            <Title>Blood Oath - V1</Title>
            <Text>The air in the internment camp was thick with tension, a palpable sense of despair hanging over the dilapidated structures. The orcs, once proud warriors, were now shackled and lethargic, prisoners of a war not of their making. Raynn's parents, among the few who had learned the orcish language, stood defiantly, voices raised in support of the orcs' release.
Thrall, the young orc Warchief, stood at the forefront, demanding the freedom of his people. Raynn's parents' pleas resonated with him, finding allies in the most unexpected places. The other humans, however, were not swayed by their arguments. Anger and prejudice fueled their violence, and the once-supportive words became a death sentence.
From her hiding place, Raynn watched in horror as her parents were mercilessly beaten, their bodies wracked with pain. Her mother lay unconscious, a pool of blood forming around her head. The brutality of the scene etched itself into Raynn's memory, fueling a mixture of fear, rage, and helplessness.
Just as the situation seemed unbearable, Grom Hellscream, a formidable orc warrior, arrived. He surveyed the grim scene, recognizing the futility of saving Raynn's parents. Her father, with a strength born of desperation, managed to convey a plea for his daughter's safety. Grom, remembering his own young son, nodded solemnly.
As Raynn's father took his last breath, Grom turned to the unconscious mother. The air was heavy with sorrow and the weight of a promise. Thrall arrived, witnessing the aftermath of the tragedy.
&quot;We need to find a human child,&quot; Grom declared, surprising Thrall with the unexpected request.
Thrall hesitated, unsure about bringing a human child into the midst of orc refugees and warriors. Grom, however, insisted that it was a blood oath – a matter of honor that could not be ignored.
It was then that Raynn, tears streaking her dirt-stained face, emerged from her hiding place to suggest a solution.
&quot;Take me to the dwarves in Dun Modr.&quot; Her voice trembled with emotion, but she regarded the orcs steadily. &quot;My father fought alongside them before. They'll keep me safe.&quot;
Grom and Thrall exchanged glances, considering the proposition. The idea seemed viable, and the promise made by Grom to Raynn's dying father lingered in the air.
&quot;Very well,&quot; Grom agreed, his voice carrying the weight of responsibility. &quot;We'll take you to the dwarves in Dun Modr.&quot;
And so, amidst the sorrowful landscape of the internment camp, a pact was formed – a promise made to a dying man, sealed with the fate of a young girl who would find an unexpected sanctuary among the dwarves.

            <Title>Southshore - Grom</Title>
            <Text>As the sun dipped toward the horizon, casting long shadows over the dockyards of Southshore, Grom Hellscream observed the orcish horde preparing to board the ships. The call to venture across the sea to an unknown land bore the weight of uncertainty in his mind. Thrall, the young Warchief, stood nearby, his expression veiled in the aftermath of their recent discussions. A sense of confusion and uncertainty lingered, but Grom's faith in Thrall took precedence in his thoughts. The impending journey held mysteries, but his trust in Thrall anchored him in purpose.
Thrall, the young Warchief, stood nearby, focused on some unseen spectacle through the mystical lens of Farsight. Grom squinted, unable to discern the details himself but trusting in Thrall's foresight.
A ripple of concern coursed through him as Thrall relayed the approach of a human army from Durnholde Keep. Grom's instincts, honed by years of battle, sensed the shifting winds of conflict. The delicate balance they sought with the humans seemed poised on a knife's edge.
When Thrall mentioned Raynn's intervention, Grom's mind immediately leaped ahead. He foresaw the danger she willingly embraced for their cause, and a surge of pride for the young woman coursed through him. But pride was a fleeting sentiment, overtaken by the solemn reminder of a blood oath made years earlier.
&quot;Thrall,&quot; Grom's voice rumbled, the weight of his words carrying the resonance of honor. &quot;We made a blood oath to protect that human child. You know what this means.&quot;
Thrall hesitated, and Grom knew the internal struggle his Warchief faced. The blood oath was a solemn commitment, a bond that transcended the complexities of their turbulent journey. Grom's inner turmoil mirrored Thrall's reluctance.
&quot;The humans will turn their wrath on her once they uncover her deception,&quot; Grom pressed on, guided by the unwavering principles of honor. &quot;We cannot let her face that alone. The blood oath demands it.&quot;
A strange tension lingered in the air. Grom sensed Thrall's resistance, the unspoken hesitance that swirled around them. The connection between the Warchief and the human woman held a significance that transcended mere duty.
&quot;The immediate threat is from the humans,&quot; Grom asserted, his gaze meeting Thrall's. &quot;With her with us, we can better protect her and fulfill the oath we made.&quot;
The unspoken acknowledgment passed between them, and Grom saw Thrall relent to the insistence of honor. The resonance of the blood oath echoed in Grom's thoughts as they spurred their war wolves into action. The impending journey across the sea now intertwined with the duty to shield a human woman, a reminder that honor knew no bounds.</Text>

            <Synopsis>- Bryna is in Jaina's study when Raynn arrives
- Jaina and Raynn greet each other warmly
- Raynn recognizes Bryna
- Explanations ensue
- Jaina offers to upgrade Raynn's circlet</Synopsis>
            <Text>At the top of the tower, curled up in a soft chair in Jaina’s study, Bryna flipped through yet another dead end of a book. Bright sunlight spilled in through the thick glass windows that pierced the upper chamber’s walls on all sides. Motes of dust swirled lazily through the light, and Bryna took a moment to watch one run through its circular path.
She and Jaina had scoured every book in the arch-mage’s library, it seemed, to no avail. There had been plenty of powerful spells that Bryna had determined she needed to return to learn someday, but nothing to induce memory loss.
The peaceful quiet of the tower chamber was broken by heavy booted footsteps, coming up from the ramp leading below. Bryna looked up curiously, and her eyes widened at the sight of a familiar auburn ponytail entering the room. Some of the warrior’s armor looked different, gleaming darkly rather than grey iron, and shimmering with impressive magic too.
But before Bryna could say anything, Jaina gave a happy exclamation. “Raynn!” The arch-mage rose and swiftly crossed to the warrior, drawing her into an embrace. To Bryna’s surprise, the usually stiff warrior didn’t recoil, but instead returned the embrace warmly.
“Jaina,” Raynn was smiling easily. “It’s good to see you again.” She noticed Bryna then, and her amber eyes widened in surprise. “Bryna?”
Jaina stepped back, looking between the two. “You know each other?”
Bryna stood, crossing to join them. “We met in Westfall.” She thought for a moment. “That’s really what started all of this.”
Raynn gave her a sharp look. “All this? It wasn’t over after Lescovar?”
She hadn’t hesitated to name the target of their less-than-legal intervention in Stormwind, Bryna noted. Raynn seemed to trust Jaina implicitly.
“How do you two know each other?” Bryna asked instead.
“Raynn stayed here for a while when she was younger,” Jaina told Bryna, which just opened up more questions, but the arch-mage moved on to answer Raynn’s query. “Bryna came here to study.” She indicated the bookshelves lining the walls of the office. “Her friends showed up not long after, investigating…” She sighed wistfully before continuing. “I had arranged for Varian Wrynn and Thrall to meet, to discuss a more lasting peace.”
Raynn’s eyes widened, reflecting surprise and an unmistakable surge of excited hope that caught Bryna off guard.
Jaina continued though, “Varian’s ship disappeared en route to Theramore.” Raynn’s shoulders slumped in disappointment, but her face was thoughtful as she listened to the rest of the story. “Bryna’s friends found signs that the Defias were involved, and traced the matter here, where they aided in my own investigation. They located a shipwreck off the coast to the north, and signs that a prisoner had been held on Alcaz Island, but there is nothing left there now.”
“Varian is back in Stormwind now,” Bryna finished. “He doesn’t remember the abduction, but we’re still curious.” She deliberately left out who was involved in the ‘we.’ An old question rose in her memory. “Who did you deliver Trias’s report to?”
Blinking, Raynn replied, “Anduin. He took the throne when Varian disappeared?” She sounded uncertain, as though still piecing it together in her mind. “Well, Lady Prestor actually took the report.” She frowned with distaste at the name. “She was unpleasant.” Raynn shot an apologetic glance at Jaina. “I spent the first three years in Ironforge,” she admitted suddenly, confusing Bryna again.
Jaina smiled understandingly though. “You did return to Stormwind though, it seems?”
Raynn nodded. “The Dwarves have a good library,” she added defensively. “I learned a lot there too. About Stormwind and…the liberation of Khaz Modan.”
Bryna tried to follow the conversation, but there was a lot being left unsaid, and she realized that she was watching the reunion of two close friends.
Surprising, as she hadn’t realized Raynn allowed anyone close to her. She wondered briefly if Shaw knew about this connection, but immediately dismissed the thought. Shaw’s curiosity didn’t matter, on the matter of Raynn’s background, at least.
Jaina broke the moment of quiet understanding between herself and Raynn suddenly, reaching up to touch the warrior’s temple lightly. Feeling something there, she gave a delighted smile. “You still have it?!”
Raynn’s face broke into another genuine smile as she nodded. “Of course!” She reached up, and to Bryna’s surprise and fascination, she pulled off a magical circlet, the gold band shimmering into existence as it came free.
Jaina looked at the object for a moment, then held out her hand. “Let me see if I can improve on my old work.” Remembering Bryna’s presence, she cast an inviting look her way. “Come on, see what you can learn.”
Eagerly, Bryna accepted the invitation, as Raynn stepped back smiling at the enthusiasm of the two mages.</Text>

            <Text>Evelyn Sparks marveled at the mechanical symphony around her as Gideon Gearspark dissected the intricacies of the malfunctioning portal device. The workshop buzzed with the hum of gears and the occasional hiss of steam, creating a cacophony that, to her, sounded like the sweetest melody.

Gideon, a fellow inventor of considerable skill, examined the device with a keen eye. His workshop was a testament to a lifetime of tinkering, filled with contraptions that danced on the border between genius and madness. Evelyn couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement, a kindred spirit in the world of gears and gadgets.

&quot;Anduin Wrynn, leader of the Alliance, and company. What brings you to my humble abode?&quot; Gideon inquired, wiping his hands on a greasy rag.

Anduin explained the situation while Evelyn listened with rapt attention. Interdimensional mishaps were a familiar challenge, and her mind raced ahead, contemplating potential solutions.

Gideon scratched his head, a greasy wrench in hand. &quot;Tricky business, that is. Let me take a gander at your device.&quot;

As Gideon delved into the specifics, Evelyn couldn't resist interjecting with technical questions and suggestions. The language of gears and cogs flowed effortlessly between them, a shared dialect of inventors lost in the beauty of their craft.

After a meticulous inspection, Gideon nodded sagely. &quot;Aye, I see what went awry here. The transdimensional oscillations got tangled up with the temporal flux. Common mistake, really.&quot;

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with excitement. &quot;Can you fix it?&quot;

Gideon grinned, revealing a set of surprisingly sharp teeth. &quot;Fixing it won't be an issue, but it might take a bit of time. In the meantime, make yourselves at home. I've got a few gadgets lying around that might pique your interest.&quot;

As Evelyn and Gideon delved into the complexities of dimensional mechanics, she lost herself in the workshop's rhythmic heartbeat, each clank and whir resonating with the promise of discovery. The challenges of their mission faded into the background, overshadowed by the joy of collaboration and the boundless potential of invention.</Text>

            <Text>Background:
Daughter of refugees
Ellis Tanner, a former soldier of Stormwind, now a refugee in Arathi Highlands
Lysandra Quinn, daugher of Kirin Tor mages; no magical ability of her own; scholar studying the lethargy of the orcs
Orphaned at age 10
Lived with dwarves for 4 years
Traveled with Grom and the Warsong clan to Kalimdor
Badly injured just before Battle of Mount Hyjal; still has scars on her front and back, just above her waist
Spent time in Theramore with Jaina Proudmoore
Traveled to Stormwind shortly after Daelin Proudmoore’s death

In Year 6, Ellis and Lysandra  met when Lysandra was among the humans fleeing from the Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills and Ellis was one of the soldiers protecting the refugees. They settled together in one of the refugee camps in the Arathi Highlands, and Raynn was born 10 months later. Near the end of Year 6, Ellis assisted in the liberation of Khaz Modan, fighting alongside the dwarves of Ironforge. He returned to Arathi to be with his wife and daughter, but continued to fight alongside the dwarves in the Wetlands when needed.
In Year 7 Lysandra began studying the orcs in the internment camps in Lordaeron, learning of their culture and language.
In Year 10, Lysandra became even more involved with the orcs, trying to determine the cause of their lethargy. Raynn often joined Lysandra on her visits to the camps, and began to learn the orcish language herself.
In Year 12, Raynn began to join her father at his forge. She was too young to swing the hammer herself, but watched his movements carefully and helped with light tasks. Ellis also began training Raynn to fight.

            <Title>Healing, Failed - Thrall</Title>
            <Text>Thrall's hands glowed with the soothing green energy of shamanistic healing, yet the young human warrior, Raynn, remained in a fragile state. Her life force flickered like a dim flame in the shadows, and Thrall felt a heavy sense of responsibility weighing on him. He had led the Horde through the Barrens, witnessed the ultimate sacrifice of Grom Hellscream to sever the demonic bonds, and now, in the quiet aftermath, he found himself facing the vulnerability of one lone human.
His eyes, accustomed to the harsh realities of battle, softened as he gazed upon Raynn's still form. The orcish Warchief, having recently forged an alliance with humans under Jaina Proudmoore’s guidance, felt a newfound connection to their shared struggles. He understood the fragility of life, regardless of race.
Thrall’s frustration grew as his attempts at healing proved only partially successful. A sense of helplessness settled upon him, knowing that the injured human, Raynn, needed more than he could provide. In the midst of his concern, Jaina approached, her expression a mix of curiosity and worry.
As Jaina drew closer, her eyes widened with surprise. &quot;I hadn't known... another human among your ranks,&quot; she revealed, her gaze fixed on the unconscious Raynn. &quot;Thrall, there is another way... She'll find healing among her own people.&quot;
With a determined expression, Jaina continued, &quot;Thrall, there is another way. I can take her to Stonetalon Peak, to our human encampment. She'll find healing among her own people, far from the brewing conflicts with the Night Elves and the Legion.&quot;
Thrall's gaze lingered on Raynn's unconscious form, a silent acknowledgment of the complexities entwining their paths. A moment of internal debate passed before Thrall nodded, his voice resonating with reluctant agreement. &quot;Do what you must, Jaina. Ensure she finds the healing she needs.&quot;
In a flash of teleportation magic, Raynn's still body disappeared, leaving only a lingering sense of unspoken concerns and an orc Warchief grappling with the weight of choices in the aftermath of conflict.</Text>

            <Text>Notes:
Raynn emerges as a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, where her confidence and fearlessness take center stage. In combat, she maneuvers with the precision of a seasoned warrior, displaying a controlled yet powerful approach to her movements. Like a tightly coiled spring, her energy is palpable, propelling her through battles with speed and intensity, always maintaining a firm grip on her actions.

            <Title>Dialogue</Title>
            <Text>“What were you thinking?” the man demanded, glaring angrily at Raynn, and she felt her own anger rise in return. “What sort of warrior allows a priestess to be attacked like that?”
He blinked, breaking that penetrating gaze, then broke into laugh. Just Human indeed. Carolyn smiled back as he nodded at her. “That explains a lot,” the King acknowledged.
His assessment turned to the other two then. “And you two?” His eyes ran over Raynn’s armor and Kamery’s black leather and bandanna. “SI:7?” he guessed of the rogue, gesturing for them to start back to Morgan’s Vigil.
The King frowned. “How did you know I had lost my memory? What have you discovered?” His tone carried the weight of authority.
“I haven’t returned to Stormwind yet. The man on the throne now is an impostor.” He took in their shock with an assessing glance, and seemed to make a decision. “The Black Dragonflight is involved, but we don’t know how deeply. We need Windsor’s research before we can risk a confrontation.”
“Where is Marshal Windsor?” Varian was certainly direct, Raynn realized.
“It seems that Windsor has been taken to the depths of the mountain,” King Varian stated. 
“I need a group of your finest men,” King Varian instructed the Marshal, but Maxwell continued to shake his head.
The King frowned. “That’s not enough.”
“What of Lady Prestor?” The King asked, having heard her comment, of course. 
Meanwhile, Varian had absorbed her words. His voice was furious. “Fordragon should not have dismissed this concern so easily! He sent no help?”
“What is he talking about?” King Varian asked, looking at Broll, but the elder druid looked just as confused. Kamery explained their findings and the King nodded. “I escaped over a cliff that night.”
Varian wasn’t convinced though, protesting, “It’s the Dark Iron stronghold.”
His face creased with concern, Varian looked down at her. “Will you be able to keep up?” he asked her, frowning.
The King looked taken aback by her censure, but also a little chagrined. “We must find Windsor,” he insisted.
“Where is he?” Varian demanded, looking around as he recovered from his surprise.
Varian slumped, his face falling. “We needed Windsor’s research to counter the Black Dragonflight. If his notes are lost, we have no chance to reveal the impostors.”
Varian turned back towards the large chamber. “We must retrieve the information from them then.”
Apparently Varian reached the same conclusions, and he nodded sharply, although his eyes narrowed with impatience. 
Smiling grimly, Varian held up the key they had retrieved from Forgewright’s tomb. “Perhaps this will unlock it.”
“I apologize.” His voice was rough and his breathing heavy from the recent combat, but his words rang true. “I lose myself to my rage.” Frustration flashed in his eyes.
As he rose, Varian smiled gratefully, and reached out a hand to help her up.
“Well fought,” the King said, his voice also reflecting the exertion of the recent battle. “You use that shield well.”
Varian laughed, a clear, deep sound, and moved away to see if Kamery had found anything.
“We must retrieve Ironfoe.” Varian’s firm voice broke the post-battle silence.
Varian’s eyes flashed with determination. “It would be foolish to leave such a powerful weapon in the hands of our enemies,” he insisted.
“This way.” Having seen that his healer was ready, Varian wasted no time leading them onwards. 
“Within, lie the spirits of the Summoners,” he told them. “The seven who joined Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan in summoning Ragnaros to this plane. They are bound to the will of the Elemental Lord, and hostile to intruders.” Varian’s eyes met Carolyn’s and held them. “However, they hold the secrets to dark iron, secrets that we need if we are to fight the Firelord. We need one chained to our will.”
Varian’s eyes held hers, brooking no argument. She offered none. He was stubborn, obstinate, reckless…but still her King. 
“Tell us your secrets,” Varian demanded, his voice resonating with royal authority mixed with the fading adrenaline of battle.
Varian took Raynn’s attention. “Did you learn what you needed?” the King asked her.
Grimly, Varian accepted the information. “Then our path is twofold. We must acquire this metal, and retrieve Ironfoe.”
Staring intently at the distant cavern, Varian gave voice to his impatience with waiting, “We must be close to the Firelord’s lair. That may be the entrance across the way.” 
“I do not suggest we confront the Firelord today.” He gestured to the elementals guarding the bridge. “But perhaps we could reach the entrance and gather information?” He was solicitous enough to ask Carolyn’s approval.
Varian’s feral roar drew the attention of the first two elementals immediately.
Once again, Bryna froze one in place, but this time, Varian’s wild blows shattered the delicate bonds of frost. 
As they walked back across the bridge though, he vowed, “When I retake my throne, all of Stormwind’s armies will march in here and destroy the Firelord once and for all.”
Broll had followed Varian and Windsor, and was watching the low, intense conversation now taking place between the three. 
“Maxwell is being singularly unhelpful.” The King growled. “Every moment we waste is one moment longer that my son is in the clutches of that beast. His life has already been threatened. We must unmask her, yet we still know nothing of the situation in Stormwind.”
Varian nodded shortly. “If anyone knows the situation in Stormwind, it is Mathias Shaw.”

            <Synopsis>Elthas runs next to Carolyn approaching the mountains to Tanaris.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Running beside Carolyn, Elthas decided that perhaps the cheetah wasn’t so bad after all. It was efficient, covering great distances without tiring, and it was nice to run in sync.
Before long, they were climbing up the winding pass through the southern mountains. Towards Tanaris, they now knew. Gadgetzan was just on the other side of the mountains, and from there, they would be able to hire gryphons to fly back to Theramore. Or they could explore the desert, Elthas mused. Neither of them had seen a proper desert before. It would be a far cry from their usual preference for lush forests though; he doubted they would stay long.
Eagerly, they crested the pass and paused to take in the desert sprawling before them. Sand dunes rippled in all directions, shimmering in the late morning heat. In the distance to the east, they could make out the shimmer of blue water, the sun sparkling off the waves of the ocean. Across that vast ocean somewhere, Kamery was probably completing some task or another for Shaw and SI:7.</Text>

            <Title>Titan Memories</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bryna investigates a Titan structure
- Flashbacks to asking Soridormi about Erozion's memory erasing spell on Thrall and Taretha</Synopsis>
            <Text>After that, the group had bonded even more closely. Although they still chased individual pursuits at times, they began spending more time together also. They discovered a hot spring on the northwestern slope of the dormant volcano at the center of the crater, and spent several afternoons enjoying relaxing soaks and deep conversations in the warm, pungent water.
About a week later, on one of her solo explorations, Bryna found herself on a high balcony well above the jungle floor of Un’goro Crater, even higher than the soaring treetops. The balcony surrounded an entrance built into the cliff-side; there was no apparent way up or down, but luckily, she had found the teleporter pad tucked away in a small crevice below. Williden’s constant requests for crystal gathering had been worth something after all.
The pad, like the facility itself, had been made from some sort of sandstone, darker and more brown than the grey granite of the cliffs. The balcony outside was hidden from below by the thick leaves of the giant trees that filled the crater, as well as the tendency of most people not looking this far upwards.
The wide entrance led directly into the cliff itself, as a spacious hallway was carved straight back. The corridor was perfectly squared, and intricate carvings ran down the sides of the walls. In some ways, it reminded her of the works of the Dwarves, but more elegant. The way was lit by glowing golden lights along the edges of the floor. Bryna couldn’t tell what they were; they were steady and unflickering, but didn’t seem like any magic she was familiar with.
A wide, circular room opened out at the end of the short hallway, with the floor lights following the curves of its sides. The air was dry and almost chilly after the heat of the jungle and even though the hallway hadn’t been that long, she could no longer hear the sounds of the birds in the trees outside. At the back of the chamber stood a single low console made of some type of golden metal. It’s slanting top seemed to be some sort of interface, and the rest of the room was empty, so Bryna walked over to it to investigate.
She knew that the Dwarves had found a similar Titan facility not long ago, in Uldaman, but they had yet to decipher the informational discs that they had retrieved there. She had been allowed, briefly, to examine them where they were held at the Hall of Explorers in Ironforge, but she hadn’t been able to make sense of the strange runes either.
Hoping for better results this time, Bryna studied the console. From what little she had read of the Titans, they had been powerful, and more importantly to her, knowledgeable. Having exhausted her other sources of information, she hoped that their secrets might shed some light on the magical practice of taking someone’s memory.
She had been momentarily excited when Erozion had said he had altered Thrall and Taretha’s memories, and had lingered behind to ask Soridormi afterwards. The bronze dragon had only shaken her head apologetically though. ‘It’s not a spell,’ she had explained. ‘It’s just something we can do; an innate draconic ability.’
Frowning at the memory, Bryna pushed one of the two buttons on the console, which flanked large central circle. The golden disc had a fine line down the center, and she suspected it was a cover for something below. The console was unresponsive though. Bryna tried the other button, then both together, then tried just pushing the cover open by herself. The smooth golden metal was unmoved by her efforts.
She could find no other elements on the console, although she examined every side of the thing; there were no hidden switches, buttons, or pressure plates. The rest of the room was similarly, frustratingly, plain and unhelpful.
Soridormi had said that the bronze dragons hadn’t interfered with Stormwind’s politics, but, Bryna realized as she turned the memory over in her mind, there were more dragons in the world than just bronzes. She remembered the firemane drake on Alcaz Island.
 With a sigh, Bryna turned and left, hoping that her companions were having a more productive time in the crater than she was.</Text>

            <Text>NOVEL FORMAT
About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

            <Title>The Prince and the Spy-Master</Title>
            <Synopsis>POV?
- He dismisses Kamery and heads to the keep himself
- Shaw runs into Anduin following Raynn to the forge
- Gives the Prince his cloak for disguise
- Asks why Anduin is following her
- Anduin looks contemplatively at his hand (now bare, Shaw is confused), but just says &quot;She looked at me.&quot;</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Kamery disappeared from sight, Mathias Shaw stopped abruptly on his walk to his desk. Spinning on his heel, headed towards the stairs himself, sweeping up a nondescript brown cloak from its hook on the wall along the way.
Throwing the cloak around his shoulders, he left the SI:7 headquarters by a side exit, slipping unseen through a side alley to emerge near the entrance to the Keep. The imposing white castle rose up over the city, commanding views that Shaw often envied from his third-floor office. Turrets and ramparts overlooked all possible angles.
Pausing for a moment, he studied the alert guards at the entrance to the Keep. In this peaceful time, they wouldn’t stop, or even question, visitors to the Keep. He wondered if they had taken note of the warrior who must have recently passed this way. Mentally tallying the time he had spoken with Kamery, and balancing that with the warrior’s purposeful stride and what he knew of Lady Prestor, he decided that she must have already come and gone.
His disappointment was short-lived though, as a small figure emerged from the Keep, walking confidently down the white marble steps to the main gate. Neat, well-made clothes, blond hair, and the self-assurance of a Prince. Shaw frowned. What on earth was Anduin doing leaving the Keep?
The guards stiffened, recognizing the Prince. They looked as though they would stop him, or accompany him. With a nonchalant wave of his hand, Anduin bade them stay at their posts. Obedient to a fault, the men relaxed back into their usual watchful posture as the young Prince strolled between them and out into the city.
Shaw watched, momentarily dumbfounded.
Once out of sight of the guards, the Prince did falter slightly, looking around himself in disorientation. He didn’t notice Shaw, still in the shadows of the alley. A moment later though, he spotted something, and brightened up. His pace picked up and he made his way along the canal-side pathway towards the entrance to the Dwarven District.
Following the Prince’s attention, Shaw noticed a familiar figure. She walked tall, with a confident stride, and an unmistakable tail of auburn hair swinging down her back.
Starting to put the pieces together, Shaw left his refuge. The guards payed him no attention as he crossed in front of the Keep entrance. Anduin didn’t notice him either, he noted with a frown, as he approached the Prince from behind. Sweeping off his cloak, he laid it around the boy’s shoulders and head.
Anduin started as a mass of cloth enveloped him suddenly, his heart pounding even harder. It had been an easy matter to slip away while Lady Prestor and Lord Fordragon had been arguing over the warrior’s missive. The Nobles paid him no attention, unless they wanted something from the throne, and even then, they mostly spoke to Lady Prestor. The guards in the Keep were well-trained to obey him. He felt a little guilty at using that obedience to actually leave the Keep—something he had never done before. He had rarely been out in the city, and the experience had his heart pounding and his hands cold. The rhythmic banging and clanking from the nearby Dwarven District seemed to echo his heartbeat.
He was determined to learn more about this intriguing warrior though. She had knelt, not out of subservience, he knew, but simply so that she could look him in the eye. His heart swelled at the memory. Ever since his father had disappeared, everyone had just talked over his head, even as he wore the crown. He had had the sense to leave the crown behind for this venture, he was reminded, as folds of brown cloth fell over his head and shoulders.
Pushing the folds of rough cloth aside, Anduin looked up with a mixture of annoyance and fear. He was the Prince, or King; he sometimes wasn’t sure. But he was also outside of the Keep, and he hadn’t even heard anyone approach him. A familiar face was looking down at him though, and relief flowed through him.
Shaw watched the boy in amusement for a moment. Frightened, good. But also indignant and imperious, especially now that he recognized his assailant. Helping the boy straighten the cloak, he advised, “Best to keep a low profile.”
Anduin’s shoulders slumped slightly at the reprimand and he nodded. His gaze returned to the path ahead of them, and Shaw followed his gaze to see that Raynn had disappeared. Knowing that the warrior was also a budding blacksmith, Shaw suspected that she had turned into the Dwarven District to return to the forge. Curious what about her had driven Anduin to leave the Keep, he asked the boy, “What is your interest in her?”
Anduin looked down at his left hand, his face contemplative. Shaw waited while Anduin searched for words, studying the young Prince. While business occasionally brought the spy-master to the Keep, and he and the boy knew each other on sight, they had rarely exchanged more than pleasant greetings. This particular venture showed some of the boy’s character. Eventually the Prince frowned, shrugged, and answered simply, “She looked at me.” His voice held notes of gratitude and surprise.
Confused, Shaw blinked, momentarily at a loss for words himself. He was willing to use any source for information, even the Prince himself, but he wasn’t sure what to make of this particular piece of the puzzle. What had started as idle curiosity at her unusual style while watching her practice in the yard below his office had turned into a full-blow mystery. One that had so far had spanned from Lordaeron all the way to Kalimdor, from Dwarves to as-yet-unidentified influences, and now it had touched on the heart of Stormwind. Shaw’s curiosity deepened, and he wondered if he would ever reach the bottom.
Anduin looked up at the spy-master hopefully. “What do you know about her?” he asked.</Text>

            <Text>The wind howled across the rocky terrain as Thrall, Grom, and Raynn rode toward the Thandol Span. The scars of battle were still fresh on the landscape, remnants of the recent struggle for freedom. Raynn, her gaze fixed ahead, felt a mixture of sorrow and determination. Grom, at her side, observed her in silence, while Thrall rode slightly ahead, focused on the path ahead.
Thrall turned to Raynn, his eyes reflecting the weight of their recent losses. &quot;Raynn, I know this journey has been difficult for you. We've faced tragedy, but we must press on.&quot;
Raynn nodded, her grip tightening on the reins. &quot;I understand, Thrall. My parents... they fought for a better future. I won't let their sacrifice be in vain.&quot;
Grom grunted in agreement, his orcish features etched with a mixture of sympathy and resolve. &quot;Your parents were brave warriors. They'd be proud of the strength you've shown.&quot;
As they approached the Thandol Span, the ruins of the once-grand structure loomed in the distance. Thrall guided his wolf to a halt, turning to face Raynn. &quot;This span is a symbol of both the past and the future. We must bridge the gap between our peoples and forge a new destiny.&quot;
Raynn met Thrall's gaze, a spark of determination in her eyes. &quot;I'll do whatever it takes to ensure that future, Thrall. For the Horde, for my people, and for my parents.&quot;
Grom nodded approvingly. &quot;That's the spirit, girl.  We'll overcome the challenges ahead, together.&quot;
With a shared understanding, the trio continued their journey, riding toward the Thandol Span and the uncertain future that awaited them. The echoes of their resolve lingered in the air, a testament to the strength forged in the crucible of adversity.</Text>

            <Title>Stormwind Keep</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Bryna goes to Stormwind, sans hat to keep a low profile
- Bryna meets with Prestor and Fordragon, Prestor is dismissive
- Bryna returns to Lakeshire
- Group sent back to Morgan's Vigil as deputies themselves</Synopsis>
            <Text>Stormwind was where Bryna found herself now, finding the city’s leaders decidedly less interested in the protection of the city. Arriving in the Mage’s Tower, she had been just another adventurer. She had made her way through the city without incident or recognition. The sooner this business is done, the better. It wouldn’t surprise me if Shaw could recognize me even through this illusion. I’d rather not find out how he reacts to being disobeyed.
She stood in the throne room of the Keep, taking in the ornate details of the room with interest, even as her attention stayed on the two people facing her now. Ostentatious tapestries and banners hung from the walls, and gatherings of nobles stood around the edges of the room sharing meaningless gossip with no other purpose than to show off their latest finery. Growing up in the city, she had heard tales of King Varian’s court, but these opulent fripperies contradicted all of them.
In front of the now-unremarkable mage, Lord Bolvar Fordragon read over the missive that she had delivered. “Solomon paints a dreary picture. Still, we cannot afford to send our thinly spread troops to the aid of Lakeshire on speculation. I will need proof of these claims before I can act. Perhaps Lady Prestor will be able to shed some light on this situation.” The formidable paladin deferred to the beautiful, but cold, woman standing beside him with speed that Bryna found disturbing. Her mind flashed back to Gryan Stoutmantle, in Westfall, and his determined defense of his land.
Bryna had been disappointed to find only these two here. Raynn had said that when she had been here, Prince Anduin had stood with them; now that King Varian had returned, he should have been here, with, or even instead of, his two advisors. They had only told her that the King was ‘otherwise occupied.’ Surely he hasn’t forgotten the needs of his kingdom in his amnesia.
Prestor looked at Bryna with irritation marring her fine features. Long black hair framed the Lady’s face, and Bryna was suddenly glad that she had chosen lighter brown for her current illusion. She would not have wanted to share anything with this haughty noblewoman.
“Would you suggest we lower our defenses here based solely on the word of some heat-addled riff-raff and a paranoid magistrate?” One thin, shapely brow raised, as she condescendingly explained, “You are an unfortunate pawn, caught in the political theatrics that often unfold between common citizenry and royalty.” She obviously seemed to include herself in the latter category. Bryna understood why Raynn had called her ‘unpleasant.’
Beside her, Fordragon seemed pensive. “Perhaps there is a solution to this dilemma that may put all our concerns to rest. I am empowering you as an acting deputy of Stormwind, authorized to investigate this matter further.”” From a pouch on his belt, he extracted a document carrying an official seal and handed it to Bryna. Her hand took it automatically, even as her mind processed the absurdity of this ‘solution.’
“Should you find indisputable proof,” Fordragon continued, “return it here to me, and I will dispense sufficient military force to aid Lakeshire.” At Fordragon’s instructions, Bryna felt the muscles in her jaw tighten to keep it from dropping open in disbelief. Nondescript little me is what you send to investigate something of this import? You can’t possibly be taking this seriously. Well, if it’s proof you want, that’s what we’ll get you, then we’ll see…
Her eyes narrowing, Prestor placed her hand on Fordragon’s upper arm. The paladin stiffened slightly, and nodded dismissal to Bryna. Bryna realized it was taking more and more effort to keep her features placid. Usually the bland expression came so easily, but there was so much going on here, so many undercurrents that she couldn’t quite figure out.
With one last covert glance around hoping to glimpse King Varian, Bryna turned to leave, disappointed to have not seen the King, and his lost memory, for herself. Not that I would have been able to ask him how he lost his memory here and now.
Prestor, however, hadn’t quite gotten the last word. “The world has enough ‘heroes,’ mage. I would recommend considering a new career path.” Bryna forced herself to ignore the comment, focusing on steadily placing one foot in front of the other.
As she walked down the main corridor of the Keep, Bryna could feel the woman’s sneer on the back of her neck all the way to the main gates. It took all of her willpower to stay relaxed as she made her way alongside the winding canals of the familiar city.
Skirting Old Town, she kept close to the houses lining the way, hoping to stay out of sight of Shaw’s tower office beyond the low rooftops of the area. It was ridiculous to think that he would be able to identify her from his window, but she still felt a sense of relief when she reached the gryphon master and paid for the flight to return her to Lakeshire and her friends.
The flight would give her time to process and catalog the encounter. Although Prestor’s attitude had rankled, she was aware of the supercilious nature of many of the nobles. Fordragon’s dismissal had been more of a disappointment though; she would have expected more of the paladin than to defer to the noblewoman, advisor or not. And where had Varian been?</Text>

            <Notes>- Bryna’s got all the pieces now: she knows Dragons can manipulate memories; she knows Dragons can take mortal visages
- Doesn’t she suspect anything in Stormwind?
- Is Onyxia using some sort of magic to muddle Bryna’s mind too? Why is she so unpleasant to adventurers anyway? She uses charm on others. Is it because they’re female? Or not noble? What is her logic here? Condescension for all mortals, but Varian and Bolvar are useful - adventurers are not.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>- Carolyn thinks about morality
- Trias sends them to the Keep
- Tyrion sends them to gather materials
- Bry’s reaction to his “disguise” (disturbed at first, impressed by how it came together)
- Lescovar and Marzon arrive and die</Synopsis>
            <Text>Carolyn blinked, absorbing the statement. She had always suspected that Kamery’s work sometimes crossed to the wrong side of the law, but being faced with the bold statement had her mind reeling. Trias had been so calm about it too. Glancing about, she took in the reactions of the rest of the group.
Kamery, of course, looked unbothered, her eyes calm over the top of her black bandanna. Raynn’s face was still hard, as it had been since the Stockades. Carolyn suspected that the warrior would gladly kill the entire House of Nobles if they seemed connected to Thedd. She suppressed a sigh; there was more going on there that any of them knew. Bryna, to Carolyn’s surprise, was also nodding in agreement. Elthas, like her, was watching the others, and seeing their agreement, his fur rippled in what amounted to a feline shrug. She knew that the druid’s sense of morality was anchored more in the natural world, with an innate acceptance of predators and prey.
Deciding that she would much prefer to be predator this time, Carolyn also nodded. At their agreement, Trias gave them directions how to find Tyrion, within the gardens of the Keep itself. Her stomach gave a little flip at that thought. Stormwind Keep loomed over the eastern end of the city, gleaming white and ornate, even more impressive than the city itself. She had glimpsed it a few times in her youth—had passed right by its front gates last year, heading to the Deeprun Tram, en route to Darnassus. She had never dreamed of actually entering the marble halls though.
Trias shooed them out of his shop in short order; now that he had done his part, he returned to the role of simple cheese merchant.
Once back in the bustling streets, Raynn took the lead, guiding them back down the same side street that she and Kamery had arrived from earlier. The warrior was familiar with the city, more so than Carolyn herself, although Carolyn had grown up in Elwynn Forest, just outside the gates. Reaching the canal, they crossed a bridge to Old Town, and Raynn turned right, continuing along the edge of the waterway that surrounded the district.
Carolyn found herself at the back of the group, as Kamery and Raynn led the way with firm purpose, and Bryna kept up with the easy strides of one familiar with the route. Elthas dropped back beside her, shifting out of feline form to walk with her. Curious, Carolyn glanced up at the tall Kaldorei. She rarely saw him out of form, and among the Humans of Stormwind, he was an impressive sight. 
The druid was tall and muscular, with waist-length dark blue hair, and the long pointed ears of his kind. He wore leather leggings and a vest that was cut deep and sleeveless, showing off the druidic tattoos that wrapped around his torso and arms. His feline form also had tattoos dyed into its fur at the shoulders, but those on the Kaldorei were much more intricate and extensive. His face was long, with deeply chiseled features and a strong aquiline nose. Familiar eyes looked down at her though, glowing with the inherent magic of his people, and now, sparkling with amusement at her perusal.
Carolyn smiled at him, trying to convey all of her friendship and gratitude. Elthas nodded solemnly in understanding. They walked quietly for a moment, until his personality got the better of him. Older than she by several decades, he was still young by his people’s standards.
“You have to learn the priest version soon,” he said, referring to the resurrection spell. “I’m very curious!” He gave her a grin.
Carolyn laughed, and nodded her agreement, but warned him, “I won’t be able to cast it in combat, you know.”
Elthas shrugged, undeterred, and retorted, “You’ll just have to thump my vanquisher with your staff first, then.”
Shaking her head in amused resignation, Carolyn realized that they had reached the end of the canal, where the entrance to the Keep was located. Guards flanked the opening, but in these times of peace, they barely glanced at the visitors.
Raynn led them easily through the marble hallways, her step still swift and purposeful, barely giving Carolyn time to admire the paintings hung along the walls. As they emerged into a garden courtyard, cool, fresh air greeted them, carrying a light floral scent. A promenade ringed the area, surrounding a low raised platform. Atop the platform grew a modest square of neatly tended grass, with several shrubs around the edges. Across from them, arched openings between marble pillars offered views of the hills in the distance, bathed in afternoon sunlight.
“You’ve been here before?” Kamery couldn’t quite keep the surprise out of her voice.
Raynn nodded, with a wry smile. She pointed to a doorway in the wall to their right as she answered, “They have a decent library here.”
Amused, Carolyn watched Kamery blink in surprise. The warrior had obviously learned the history of the Stonemasons from books written for the House of Nobles, which she likely would have found here.
“You want what?!” Bryna’s scandalized voice from nearby drew her attention. The mage hadn’t forgotten their mission, and was already talking to their contact, a middle-aged Gnome sitting on one of the marble benches at the edge of the promenade, across from the library entrance.
Intrigued Carolyn approached the pair. Bryna gave her a disbelieving look.
“He wants three bolts of silk!” The indignant mage exclaimed.
“Keep your voice down. We don’t need to attract attention,” Tyrion chastised. He added, “And two apples. Don’t forget the apples.”
Carolyn shook her head to clear the confusion, but it didn’t help. “Silk and apples?” she questioned.
“Yes,” the Gnome nodded emphatically. “Trias has pushed the timetable up here. We can do that, but my preparations are not ready yet.”
Carolyn considered her meager supplies. “I could maybe put together one bolt,” she offered.
Bryna waved her hand dismissively. “I’ll get the silk.” She seemed to have adjusted to the request.
“I have apples,” Elthas offered. He had returned to feline form as they had entered the Keep, and his voice made the Gnome startle.
Carolyn caught a smirk on Bryna’s face, as the mage disappeared in a teleportation spell.
“What’s going on?” Raynn questioned. She and Kamery had apparently been distracted by their continuing conversation about the library.
Tyrion answered, filling in the details that Trias had omitted, “I’ve been watching Lescovar for a couple of weeks now. Trias has never trusted him, but we didn’t suspect he was involved in anything to do with the Defias Brotherhood. We were following leads that tied him to the Twilight’s Hammer. Either way, he’s become more dangerous than this city can deal with, and that’s where we come in.”
Kamery looked around the courtyard. “Even if we get him out here, what about the guards?” she asked.
“Don’t worry, I have a plan, once you provide the finishing touches,” the Gnome assured them.
A moment later, Bryna returned, silently handing the Gnome an armload of silk cloth with a suspicious look.
His hands busied themselves, wrapping the silk around an inert mechanical construct that stood beside him, twisting and folding the fine fabric in a pattern that only he seemed to understand. As he worked, he outlined the plan. “After I put on Spybot’s”—his hands indicated the construct—“disguise, he’ll head in to talk to Lescovar. The guards should let him pass no problem. Trias will have gotten word to Marzon that it is time to meet with Lescovar again, and fed him some false information. Apples!”
Startled by the sudden barked order, Elthas nonetheless handed over two apples from his pack, and Tyrion continued, “Lescovar will dismiss his guards and wait for Marzon out here in the garden. After you catch wind of talk about the Defias, make your move. You need to kill them both before the guards return!”
He was tucking the apples into the silk in a way that made Carolyn blink several times in disbelief. Glancing at Bryna, she noticed that the other tailor had turned away, and was studiously ignoring the Gnome’s handiwork.
“When you’re done,” Tyrion concluded, “speak to Trias. I’m doing the hard part here, but I’ll be gone when you do the dirty work.”
With a final flourish, Tyrion finished his work and stepped back. The mechanical Spybot whirred to life, moving jerkily. Carolyn wondered how the awkward-looking thing was going to get past anyone, let alone the stoic guards of Stormwind Keep, when it suddenly spun about and transformed into a beautiful woman in elaborate silk robes. Bryna whistled low in appreciation of the illusion magic.
Tyrion gave the mage a smug smirk as he packed up his remaining materials—including, Carolyn noticed, at least a bolt’s worth of silk cloth.
Raynn started forward, as the Spybot approached the guards, but Kamery pulled the warrior back.
“Stay out of sight,” the rogue whispered, gesturing to the thick bushes that edged the garden. Carolyn joined the others in the shadows of the bushes, peering through the tangled branches to see the Spybot pass the guards easily and enter the library, where Lescovar awaited. She felt a thrill at the covertness as Lescovar emerged and dismissed all of the guards. Is this how Kamery always feels? she wondered, understanding her sister a little better.
Another man entered the courtyard from the Keep a few moments later, and approached the Lord. As the assassin told Lescovar that he had heard rumors of SI:7 snooping about, Carolyn realized that Kamery and Elthas were no longer with them. Knowing that if she so much as twitched, the two in the courtyard would spot her, she decided that she had a long way to go to truly understand her sister’s abilities.
“What’s this?!” Lescovar shouted, as Raynn surged forwards out of hiding. Carolyn realized that the conversation had ended, and Marzon was leaving. They couldn’t let him escape! She leaped forwards with her staff ready, but Bryna was even quicker, teleporting past her in a blink. With a flick of her hands out to her sides, the mage cast a ring of frost that anchored the assassin’s feet to the marble floor. With a snarl, Marzon slashed out at Bryna with his daggers, but she danced away out of range, smirking.
Settling into her role as healer, Carolyn assessed the situation. In the middle of the grassy courtyard, Raynn was skillfully parrying and blocking Lescovar’s clumsy attacks, his sword clashing against her sword and shield, even as she glanced over her shoulder to ascertain the assassin’s position. Kamery and Elthas were also attacking the nobleman. Marzon was temporarily frozen in place on the promenade, but he had reversed the dagger in his right hand, raising his arm for a throw.
Carolyn was faster, her shield spell shimmering around Bryna an instant before the dagger struck at the mage. A second later, a frosty shield rose up, joining the holy one. Assured that Bryna was safe for the moment, Carolyn turned her attention to Raynn, putting a slow-acting healing spell on the warrior with a whispered word. Although Raynn’s shield was blocking most of the damage, the spell would renew her strength without Carolyn needing to focus for long. She had learned the quick spell from the Kaldorei; it was similar in effect to Elthas’s healing spells, but drawing from the Light rather than nature. Carolyn found it a useful part of her arsenal.
With a well-considered move to the other side of the grassy area, Bryna had put Raynn between her and the angry assassin. The warrior’s feet moved deliberately, drawing Lescovar with her to engage Marzon in combat also. Distracted by the more immediate threat, the assassin gave up his attack on Bryna.
Impressed, Carolyn watched as the warrior skillfully maneuvered the fight at the edge of the garden. Now two opponents who had originally been on opposite sides of her were now both in front of her, where she could use her sword and shield to block their blows. Her shield was a solid bulwark, absorbing most of the damage, and she dodged and parried easily.
Raynn’s sword flashed out in a twisting move, and Marzon’s remaining dagger clattered to the marble floor of the surrounding walkway. He was unarmed, but Bryna’s frost-bolts continued to pelt him until he fell, unmoving. Glancing over, Carolyn saw the mage’s face set in determination as cold as her spells. She reminded herself that the man had been an assassin, and working for the Defias.
Seeing his hired thug fall, Lescovar faltered. Kamery was equally ruthless though, her daggers finding a weakness, and he also fell.
Carolyn cast a group healing spell, to take care of any small injuries and battle fatigue. It had been an easy fight, she reflected. The five of them worked together well.</Text>

            <Title>Adventures in Stonetalon</Title>
            <Text>Carolyn whispered a spell under her breath as she ran down the dirt road. The pain in her arm faded slightly, continuing to fade as the holy magic did its work. Her blonde hair, loosely knotted at the back of her head, bounced with each step. That last fight had been too close for comfort. She could still hear the harpies screeching angrily behind them, but the sound was fading into the distance now.
“El,” she panted, trying to catch her breath. “Slow down!”
Ahead of her, her companion did as asked, turning back to look at her with shining golden eyes. The druid was in his feline form, as usual. The sleek black panther could run swiftly and seemingly forever. She wondered if all druids were like that, or if Elthas was particularly energetic. The other druids that she had met in Darnassus had been mostly relaxed, almost seeming ready to slip into the Emerald Dream themselves at any moment.
“You’re injured!” Elthas’s voice carried genuine surprise, and concern. He had shifted out of his feline form with a speed that took Carolyn by surprise no matter how many times she witnessed it. As a Kaldorei, he was a full head taller than her, with broad shoulders and a trim waist. Curving druidic symbols were tattooed in dark ink on the dusky violet skin of both of his muscular arms. Green nature magic glowed in his large hands, then surrounded her. She felt the invigorating surge of his healing add to her own holy spell.
“I’ll be fine now. Thanks.” Her lips curved gently upwards as she looked up at the young druid. He might prefer to be a panther all day, but he was more than ready with healing when needed. She glanced down at her arm and saw that the jagged slice was nearly completely healed now, with the last vestige of redness fading away as she watched. Her white robe didn’t heal as easily, but she had thread back at the inn to deal with that.
Elthas had returned to her side, also watching her arm. Nodding in satisfaction, he suggested with characteristic good spirits, “Maybe we should avoid the harpy nest for now.” They had been traveling and adventuring together for just over a year now, and she had never seen him lose his optimism. Even after their worst defeats, he just shrugged it off and suggested they move on.
Carolyn’s smile widened and she nodded in agreement. Glancing around at the cobweb filled forest they had stopped in, she shuddered. “Let’s just get back to the inn for now. We can figure out where to go next from there. Just remember, I can’t keep up with your feline form!”
Elthas hung his head, his waist-length dark blue hair falling forward around his angular face. Carolyn wondered why he didn’t tie it back, but as he shifted smoothly back into panther form, she changed her internal query to wondering if the shorter fur was the reason for his preference. She patted her own hair, tucking a few stray strands back into the knot.
Her hair once more neat and tidy, Carolyn resumed her jog back to the inn. Once they left the musty, spider-infested grove behind, the sparse pine forest of the Stonetalon Mountains made for pleasant traveling. Elthas remembered to slow his pace, stopping every few steps to look back at her. Carolyn spent the time anticipating a soak in the nearby hot spring.
When they approached the inn however, her plans were changed by the innkeeper. As they passed his desk, he waved her over, holding out a letter. Taking the cream-colored parchment, Carolyn eyed the missive in mild confusion. Who would be writing to her out here? Who even knew she was here? The last time she had written to Kamery, they had still been in Astranaar, so any response would have needed to be forwarded on. Knowing how long it took the ship to cross the sea between them, Carolyn wasn’t even sure if Kamery would have received her latest letter yet.
Elthas leaned into her leg, and she knew he was also curious. “I don’t know who it’s from,” she answered his unspoken question. “Let’s find out.”
The broad veranda at the back of the building offered a quiet place to read, so Carolyn quickly crossed the inn’s common area. Settling on a bench against the railing, she tucked her long robes around her. The open architecture of the Kaldorei never ceased to soothe her; the smooth, curving lines and wide, airy spaces made the inn feel as if it had been grown rather than built. A cool breeze caressed her skin, bringing with it the fresh, sharp scent of pines. Elthas jumped up on the seat beside her, and started licking one massive paw. She cast a wistful glance down to the hot spring below before giving in to her curiosity.
Turning the the letter over in her hands, Carolyn studied the address. “Carolyn Wilson, Stonetalon Peak Inn” were all that were written; she didn’t recognize the crisp, blocky penmanship. Breaking the unmarked blob of blue wax that held the letter closed, she unfolded it, to find familiar handwriting. “It is from Kam!” Delighted surprise filled her. She hadn’t expected to hear from her twin sister again so soon. In her last letter, Kamery had sounded busy with her work, the details of which, of course, she could never mention. Carolyn understood enough about SI:7 though, that her imagination filled in all sorts of interesting, albeit dangerous, escapades. Kam, she was confident, could handle herself.
As Carolyn scanned the contents of the letter, though, she realized that perhaps Kamery had gotten in over her head this time. “At least she has the sense to ask for help,” Carolyn muttered. The thought of her competent, self-assured sister in a situation where she felt the need to ask for help chilled her.
Elthas butted his head up against her arm, his whiskers tickling her skin through the tear in her robe. “What’s happened?” he asked, his smooth voice coming easily from the panther’s throat. Carolyn had never understood what sort of druidic magic made that possible, but she was used to it by now.
“Kam’s got an assignment. She doesn’t say much, but asks if I could return to help her.” Carolyn looked over at the big cat next to her. Looking back down at the letter, she read her sister’s words. “’I’ve run into a bit of a situation here. We could use your talent.’ I doubt she’s talking about my strategic senses.” Carolyn gave her sleeve a rueful look. “I think she wants a healer.”
Elthas’s head tilted to one side. “We?” he asked.
Carolyn looked back at the letter, surprised. “Yes. I missed that,” she admitted. “I have no idea what she’s gotten into, but she’s my sister.” She would answer her sister’s call, there was no doubt of that. They were all each other had, and had always been close, despite their differences. Beyond that, Carolyn knew that whatever her methodology, Kamery was working for the betterment of the world. The sisters had at least shared the same desire for justice.
“We’ve run out of things to do here anyway, haven’t we?” Elthas always found the positive in anything. Carolyn looked back at him and saw that the druid was smiling, the sight a bit disconcerting with his fangs bared.
Carolyn chuckled. “Yes, we have. Do you want to see Stormwind? It could be dangerous.” Elthas was nodding before she even finished the question. She wasn’t sure if he even heard the warning.
“I’ll go talk to the hippogryph master. He can get us to Auberdine quickly!” The sleek panther leaped off the bench and trotted eagerly out of the inn, leaving Carolyn with her thoughts.
“I guess I’ll go pack.” Carolyn spoke softly to herself. At least the sea journey would give her time to mend her robe.
“We should get a portal in Darnassus.” Elthas had circled back with the thought. He didn’t give her a chance to answer though, just ran out of the inn again. Carolyn laughed softly at his unquenchable spirit. So much for mending the robe.</Text>

            <Title>Blood Oath - Thrall</Title>
            <Text>In the dimming light, Thrall surveyed the aftermath of battle, his piercing green eyes settling on the lifeless forms of Ellis and Lysandra. Confusion and concern etched across his features as he sought answers from Grom, who stood resolute beside him.
&quot;What has transpired here?&quot; Thrall inquired, his gaze lingering on the battered bodies.
Grom's response resonated through the air, heavy with the weight of recent actions. &quot;They were near death, Thrall. Beaten. I offered the man a quick end. Before he died, he made me swear to find and protect his child.&quot;
Thrall's brow furrowed, his eyes narrowing as he observed the state of the fallen humans. A child? The realization of the severity of their injuries cut through him. &quot;A child, Grom? In the midst of our war-band? It is no place for a human. They won't survive among us. We are on a mission to liberate our people.&quot;
Grom's determination clashed with Thrall's skepticism. &quot;Thrall, it's a matter of honor. A blood oath. I won't break it.&quot;
The gravity of the situation bore down on Thrall as he hesitated. His thoughts echoed in the silence, grappling with the conflicting demands of duty and compassion. The revelation of a blood oath added a layer of solemnity to the decision at hand. &quot;A blood oath, Thrall,&quot; Grom reiterated, emphasizing the sacredness of the vow.
Thrall, acknowledging the weight of the oath, finally relented. &quot;Very well, Grom. But the risks are great. We must be cautious.&quot;
As they rode towards the Thandol Span, Thrall's mind wrestled with the implications of their newfound charge. The promise to protect a human child reverberated within him, setting the tone for the journey ahead, marked by uncertainty and duty.

            <Title>Crossing the Barrens</Title>
            <Synopsis>Grom's struggles to protect Raynn amidst his growing bloodlust.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Barrens stretched out before Grom Hellscream, a vast, desolate land echoing with the footsteps of the Warsong clan. The orcs, disciplined and resolute, marched through the arid terrain. Grom's eyes, once filled with the fiery spirit of a warrior, now flickered with the unsettling glow of a growing bloodlust.

In the fading light of the Barrens, Grom's thoughts were consumed by the ever-intensifying rage that coursed through his veins. Thrall, the Warchief, had ventured to Stonetalon Peak, seeking guidance from the elusive Oracle, leaving Grom to lead the Warsong orcs through the unfamiliar landscapes of Kalimdor.

Raynn, the young human girl he had pledged to protect, walked among the orcs, a beacon of innocence in the midst of the encroaching darkness. Grom's blood oath to safeguard her clashed with the relentless fury building within him. He had been training Raynn, sparring with her in the evenings, but the growing bloodlust made these sessions increasingly challenging.

As the Warsong clan moved through the Barrens and Ashenvale, skirmishes with the humans became more frequent. Grom, wrestling with the internal conflict, led raids against the Alliance forces. The clashes were violent, the air filled with the clash of weapons and war cries.

Raynn, too young to join the war-bands, remained with the non-combatants. Grom's gaze would occasionally find her among the orcs, a reminder of the promise he had made to her father. In the evenings, despite the turmoil within him, Grom continued to spar with Raynn, his gruff exterior hiding the internal struggle against the encroaching bloodlust.

The training sessions became a battleground of their own, a reflection of Grom's inner turmoil. His strikes, once precise and controlled, now bore the mark of an orc succumbing to the unrelenting desire for combat. Raynn, determined and resilient, faced him with the spirit of a warrior.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Grom stood amidst the aftermath of yet another skirmish. The metallic scent of blood filled the air, and his eyes met Raynn's, a silent exchange that spoke of the complexity entwining their fates.

Bound by blood and duty, Grom and Raynn continued their journey through Kalimdor, the shadows of the Barrens mirroring the growing storm within the Hellscream's heart.</Text>

            <Title>Northwatch Goodbyes - Raynn</Title>
            <Synopsis>Continuation of goodbyes overlooking Northwatch. Raynn steps through the portal to Stormwind.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Raynn absorbed Thrall's words, a sense of gratitude and determination welling within her. Jaina's suggestion of Stormwind resonated, promising a journey into her father's legacy.
She turned to Thrall, her voice steady but laced with gratitude, &quot;Thank you, Warchief. For everything.&quot;
Thrall inclined his head, a silent acknowledgment of their shared journey. &quot;May the winds guide your steps, Raynn. Find the path that leads to your true self.&quot;
The prospect of leaving Kalimdor stirred conflicting emotions, but the promise of discovering her heritage held its own allure.
Jaina, a newfound friend in this tumultuous world, stepped closer, her eyes holding warmth that transcended the scars of conflict. &quot;Stormwind awaits, and within its walls, you may find the missing pieces of your story. Safe travels, Raynn.&quot;
Thrall extended a hand to Raynn. &quot;May the spirits watch over you, young one.&quot;
Raynn clasped his hand firmly. &quot;And may they guide you in whatever challenges lie ahead, Warchief.&quot;
Jaina, her eyes reflecting both understanding and warmth, approached. &quot;It's not a farewell, Raynn, but a new beginning. Stormwind awaits, with your father’s people and a chance to embrace the roots of your heritage.&quot;
Raynn nodded, a mix of anticipation and nostalgia tugging at her heart. &quot;Thank you, Jaina. I won't forget the friends I've made here.&quot;
Thrall's voice held a weight of shared history. &quot;Your journey is your own, Raynn. But remember, the bonds forged in Kalimdor will endure.&quot;
As she prepared to step through the portal, she turned to Thrall and Jaina. &quot;Perhaps our paths will cross again. Until then, thank you—for believing in me.&quot;
&quot;Until we meet again,&quot; Thrall's deep voice resonated.
With a determined yet wistful smile, she stepped into the shimmering portal, and the windswept landscape of Durotar faded, replaced by the bustling cityscape of Stormwind. The foreign scents and sounds enveloped her, a stark contrast to the untamed wilds of Kalimdor. Raynn took a deep breath, embracing the uncertainty of a new chapter as the portal closed behind her, leaving behind echoes of shared history with the friends she'd found among orcs and humans alike.
In Kalimdor, Thrall and Jaina watched the portal fade, a bittersweet tableau on the hill. The echoes of shared history lingered, and as the winds whispered promises of change, they stood united in the hope that Raynn would find her place in the tapestry of Azeroth.</Text>
            <Notes>
Your scene is well-crafted, but here are a few suggestions that might enhance it:
Emphasize Raynn's Internal Conflict: Highlight Raynn's internal conflict about leaving Kalimdor. Is she torn between her attachments to the orcs and the promise of discovering her heritage in Stormwind? You can delve a bit more into her thoughts to convey this inner struggle.
Explore Jaina's Perspective: Consider adding a brief snippet from Jaina's perspective as Raynn steps through the portal. What might Jaina be thinking or feeling in that moment? This can add an extra layer to Jaina's character and her connection with Raynn.
Sensory Details in Stormwind: When Raynn arrives in Stormwind, you've mentioned the bustling cityscape. You could incorporate a few sensory details—perhaps the sounds of the city, the scent of unfamiliar flowers or foods, or the feel of the cobblestone streets under her boots—to immerse the reader in this new environment.
Foreshadowing or Symbolism: If there are any recurring themes, symbols, or foreshadowing elements in your story, consider subtly weaving them into this scene. It could be a small detail or a line that hints at things to come, adding depth to the narrative.
Reflect on Shared Experiences: As Raynn leaves, you might include a brief reflection on the shared experiences she had with Thrall and Jaina. This could be a moment where they think about the battles fought together, the challenges faced, and the growth witnessed in each other.</Notes>

            <Title>Stranglethorn Vale</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Raynn trains with Galvan the Ancient in Stranglethorn Vale</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Raynn focused on her mining pick, her muscles stretched and tightened, directing the tool to just the right spot on the vein of ore before her. A dull orange gem was embedded in the raw mithril, barely visible, and she knew that she had to work carefully to free it without shattering it into too many useless pieces. She willed herself to block out the sounds of the surrounding jungle and the sensation of sweat dripping down her temples and back.
A wild jungle, Stranglethorn Vale was hot, humid, and filled with wildlife. The snap and growl of dueling raptors came from somewhere in the undergrowth nearby. From further away, the droning chants of Troll witch doctors near their temple of Zul Gurub reached her ears. The Ogres at Mosh’Ogg were quieter, but that only made them more dangerous with the element of surprise. Raynn sometimes wondered how such large awkward-looking beings could move so stealthily through the rough landscape.
Now was not the time for idle thoughts though, she reminded herself, making another light tap with her pick. Experience over the last few weeks had taught her that the Ogres and Trolls would keep to themselves unless provoked. The raptors could be more aggressive, but today it sounded as though they were turning that aggression on each other. Raynn could focus on her mining in relative peace.
While she had come looking for blacksmithing advice, Galvan had insisted that mining went hand in hand with the craft; he had sent her out to collect materials before he would teach her anything. The Dwarf was strange, but she had admired the workmanship of his own armor. The gleaming blue-black metal had been ornate, and wrought with enchantment.
Keeping the thought of learning to make such armor in mind, she gently worked the precious gem free, then set to work extracting the rest of the ore from the vein. She almost had the materials to satisfy her new instructor.
Turning back to Galvan’s camp, Raynn pushed her way through the thick green undergrowth, tucking the fruits of her labor in her bag with the rest of the day’s finds. She had once thought Elwynn Forest to be a lush contrast to Dun Morogh—Stranglethorn made that forest seem almost barren by comparison.
Her full bag caught Galvan’s immediate attention, prompting him to let out a hearty whoop. “Your work ethic is impeccable, Raynn! You are starting to understand the ways of Galvan mineralogy.” The Dwarf reached for the satchel, and she handed it over wearily, but eager to learn what he could make with the contents.
“She's a cruel mistress, is she not, Raynn?” The Dwarf pulled out a nugget of glossy, liquid-like silvery metal. “I'm speaking of truesilver, naturally. Aye, Galvan spent over a decade in the mountains of Alterac learning this lesson.” The mention of Alterac made Raynn’s heart clench briefly with memory, but she pushed it aside, focusing on the instruction.
Unaware of her thoughts, Galvan laughed heartily, continuing to poke around in the full bag. “After such mining, your muscles bulge and your body aches! We will spent all day tomorrow learning to imbue mithril with citrine. Go rest now.”
His words were true, Raynn realized ruefully. Her body did indeed ache, and the daylight was starting to dim. Grateful for the respite, she sank down on her bedroll in the small encampment, looking around her with the befuddlement she felt every time she returned to the small camp.
Nestled in a small cleft between rocky outcroppings, nothing about Galvan’s camp indicated that he had been living in the wilds of Stranglethorn for years, possibly decades. The forge dominated the small clearing, but it was flanked by only a campfire, and a bedroll—now two, with her own. He had cleared the undergrowth for several meters around the lower end of the dell, and that seemed to be enough to keep the wildlife at bay.
Over the campfire hung a pot of simmering stew, which emitted an aroma that was not unpleasant, but neither was it particularly enticing. The stew, which was breakfast and dinner every day, seemed to be made up from whatever edibles Galvan found and added to it each day. The varied ingredients gave the concoction an earthy, but indistinct, flavor. At least the meal was filling, and gave her energy for the next day’s work, she reflected, as Galvan handed her a full bowl.
Succumbing to exhaustion, Raynn fell into a deep sleep right after finishing her meal. When she woke to the morning sunlight filtering through the trees, she was thankful that the sleep was deep enough to stave off nightmares. Her memories occasionally welled up in her sleep, when she wasn’t aware enough to push them away. Although infrequent, those nights always left her exhausted and unsettled. She would need her focus for the upcoming work.
“Look,” Galvan greeted her, filling her vision with his broad features and wild dark hair. He held up a polished yellow-orange gem between their faces. “Citrine is a glorious gem indeed.”
Bemused, Raynn rubbed the sleep from her eyes and admired the gleaming gem. Light played on facets deep within, beneath the still-rough surface. She could sense the potential, given what she already knew about using other gems. The idea stirred her to action, as Galvan backed away.
Seeing that she was rising, Galvan moved back over to the now-lit forge. Raynn untwisted the tie from her long auburn hair, then gathered it back more neatly into its ponytail and refastened it as she followed the Dwarf.
Galvan had already laid out the materials that she had gathered over the past weeks, neatly organizing them by type of ore or gem. She looked at the sizable piles with mingled pride and surprise. It hadn’t seemed like that much as she had worked, but the dull ache in her muscles was testament to the hard work she had put in.
“Now,” the Dwarf looked at her intently, “Galvan will show you how to fortify mithril bars with citrine. Pay attention and learn!” Picking up the items in question, he gestured for her to follow his steps.
Two more weeks later, Raynn had crafted an impressive stack of imbued mithril bars, along with a new pair of gauntlets, pauldrons, and greaves. The work had been difficult, perhaps even more so than the mining; mithril was trickier to work with than iron, and the intricate details had taken great concentration. The resulting armor looked impressive and held powerful enchantments though, and Raynn was pleased.
Galvan looked at her, pride in his dark eyes as he declared, “When you came to Galvan, Galvan knew you would turn out to be a fine pupil! It was without hesitancy that you gave up that trinket of no small value to McGavan. You did this only so you could meet Galvan. Such blind faith to the craft should be rewarded.”
Bustling about, the eccentric Dwarf began hammering at a small piece of metal on the anvil.
“It is only fitting”—BANG—“that you”—BANG—“receive”—BANG—“a trinket of far”—he began tapping more gently—“greater value”—tap—“than the one”—tap—“you sacrificed”—tap—“to get here.” With one final tap, he seemed satisfied, and handed Raynn the finished object. It gleamed with the shimmer of citrine-imbued mithril, and something else deep inside that she couldn’t identify. On the face was etched an intricate emblem. Holding the trinket, she felt her entire body thrum with strength.
Galvan gave her a measured look.
“And now,” he proposed, “you face another choice. You may keep the trinket, of course. Or you may present it to my finest pupil, in Gadgetzan in Tanaris, and he will teach you the remaining secrets of imbued mithril.”
It wasn’t a choice, of course. He knew, and Raynn knew, that she would be on the next ship she could find to Tanaris.</Text>

            <Title>Refuge Point</Title>
            <Synopsis>- Shaw writes to Kamery, summoning her back to Stormwind
</Synopsis>
            <Text>The camp at Refuge Point was small now, just a remnant of what Carolyn knew had once been there. She had read the stories of the exodus from Stormwind before her birth, when the Orcish Horde had first invaded Azeroth. The city had since been rebuilt, and its people had mostly returned. Some had remained longer in the north, helping the Dwarves reclaim their lands, but even many of those had left when the Scourge invaded Lordaeron. The once-proud Kingdom was now in ruins, overrun by the undead.
They had passed a few lingering signs of the past on their journey here. One farm, nestled in a low valley beyond the road, had been overrun by zombies, the creatures still searching for something among the lifeless farmhouse and barn. The creaking of the farm’s windmill had reached them on the wind, the lonely sound only emphasizing the desolation of the scene.
From the top of the ravine that sheltered the small Human encampment, Carolyn could see the structures of one of the old Orcish internment camps in the distance. It stood on upward sloping ground, firm against the steeper hills that surrounded the highlands to the north and east. Low wooden buildings were surrounded by a sturdy wall, and she wondered how the Orcish army had managed to breach the defenses.
They had done so, she knew, but her history lessons had been sparse on details, stating only that the Horde had re-emerged, freed their Orcish brethren, then fled across the ocean. She knew more from Kalimdor, she reflected, than she did from her own continent. Lordaeron’s history had been lost to the past.
Bringing her thoughts back to the present, Carolyn followed her friends down the sloping road into the ravine. The air was cooler at the bottom, out of the direct light of the sun. The highlands weren’t overly warm, but after the cool dampness of the Wetlands, the sunlight had been harsh. She missed the wild forests of Kalimdor. Elthas’s mention of horses had reignited her old desire, and now, it seemed perhaps almost attainable.
“You must learn more of our ways.” The Kaldorei saber-master had told her when she had inquired about learning to ride the majestic cats. And she had, she reflected, with a fond glance at Elthas, who was exploring around the tents of the camp, with Bryna following bemusedly behind him. They didn’t even have an inn here, she noticed, wondering how people could live in just a tent. At least they had a gryphon master and a mailbox.
Kamery was at the mailbox now, checking for messages from Shaw, as always. While her apparent assignment now was simply to continue adventuring with her friends, there was always the chance that Stormwind’s spy-master would recall her for some other task. As her sister pulled out a sealed envelope, Carolyn shook her head in disbelief. How had Shaw known where to reach her?
Absently tucking a stray strand of hair back in its knot at the back of her head, Carolyn approached the rogue. “A new assignment?” she asked, as Kamery read the missive.
Kamery nodded, her eyes regretful. “He’s summoning me back. Alone.”
Carolyn hugged her sister. “We knew this couldn’t last forever. Besides,” she gave an impish smile, “I want to travel back to Darnassus. El has given me hope!”
Kamery laughed, returning the embrace briefly. She broke away, and tucking the letter away, pulled out her gold pouch. Extracting a handful of coins, she held them out to Carolyn. “If he’s right, then you’ll need this.”
Carolyn’s eyes widened at the proffered amount. “I can’t—” she began, but Kamery cut her off.
“I’ll take Bryna’s advice.” She patted her full bag of herbs. “You were right; I can’t possibly use them all myself.”
Carolyn smiled, accepting the gold and tucking it away in the pouch at her waist. “Thank you. I’ll find a way to repay you.”
Kamery waved her promise away with a wave of her hand. “After all I’ve dragged you through”—her eyes darkened with regret—“I’m the one who owes you.”
Carolyn reached out and squeezed her sister’s hand. “We’re sisters.”</Text>

- Boarding the ship
- Fighting more Defias
- Elthas scouts; finds explosives

            <Text>Bryna nodded her agreement. They did fight together well, she decided, allowing her mind to wander to the future for a moment. There was a whole wide world to explore, and having a group of friends like this would certainly make the dangers more manageable. That was a discussion for another time though, so she put the thought aside for now.
As Raynn led the way out of the eerily-lit smelting chamber, the air shifted. Away from the stench of molten iron, it was fresh—too fresh for this deep underground.
“Sea,” Elthas purred. Bryna blinked, realizing the druid was right. The air held a distinct saltiness that she knew well from growing up in Stormwind, overlooking the ocean.
Another door blocked the way ahead, and once again Kamery approached it with her lock-picks. Something went wrong though, and the door exploded in a sudden blast that knocked them all down. Scrambling to her feet, Bryna looked around, shaking off her daze. She had been furthest from the door, and the others were still recovering. Kamery lay near the ragged portal, blood flowing from her temple.
A shout from beyond drew Bryna’s attention back to the doorway itself. A pair of Defias pirates, their rapiers drawn, were approaching. Raynn was still groggily staggering to her feet, dazed. Straightening her hat on her head, Bryna stepped forward, one of her favorite spells on her lips.
The lead pirate let out a surprised bleat as Bryna’s spell transformed her into a sheep. She stumbled about, confused. Another spell, the frost sparkling off Bryna’s fingertips, struck the second opponent. He focused on her, running at her, but the frost wrapped itself into his limbs, slowing his movements. Bryna struck again, then danced backwards as he closed the distance. The pirate shook off the effects of the frost-bolt and charged once more. She swung her hands in a different spell, casting a nova of ice around herself, trapping his feet in place. Teleporting a few meters away, she cast two more frost-bolts, and he was finished.
Catching her breath, Bryna turned back to deal with the first pirate, only to find that her companions had recovered and had already done so. Carolyn’s hands glowed with golden light, and Kamery’s wound had closed completely. Beside the sisters, Elthas sat on his haunches, licking one paw.
Raynn gave Bryna an appreciative nod, and they turned their attention to the cavern now visible beyond the wreckage of the door. It was massive, and filled with deep water. Sunlight filtered in through a wide opening at the far end. Overhead, a bright red bird swooped at them with a loud squawk, then retreated to the far side of the ship.
The door opened onto a dock extending into the water, at the end of which loomed a massive dreadnought. Bryna sucked in her breath as her eyes scanned the armaments on the battleship. A lower deck encircled the ship, bristling with cannons, and catapults lined the upper deck. She had no doubt the inner hold of the ship was filled with explosive ammunition. The thing could level a city. Had been built to level a city, she realized, with a chill in her heart that had nothing to do with frost magic.
“They want to destroy Stormwind,” She breathed.
“We won’t let them,” Kamery avowed. “We have to find their leader, and destroy this thing.”
The group moved forward, crossing the creaking dock with determination. As they approached the end, nearing the ship, the Defias on board noticed them, and fired a cannon shot that destroyed part of the dock. The shot was mis-aimed, landing behind them, but Bryna, at the back of the group, could feel the warped planks buckle under her feet. Casting a quick spell, she teleported forwards a few meters, momentarily surprising Carolyn.
With no turning back, the group surged up the boarding ramp and onto the lower deck of the ship. Pirates approached along the deck, four from either side, and the group was surrounded.
Raynn gestured Carolyn and Bryna towards the inner wall of the lower deck, and took a position in front of them. Kamery had disappeared from sight, but one of the pirates at the back of the left group suddenly crumpled, unconscious, hinting at her position. Targeting the pirate next to him, Bryna cast polymorph again, choosing a different version for variety. Now there were only two on that side to worry about.
With a broad slash of her sword, Raynn drew in the four to the right, raising her shield to block their counterattacks. Turning to put her back to the wall, Bryna flung frost at the remaining two now on her right, buying some time. Carolyn’s heavy staff caught one across the midriff, knocking the wind out of him. Another swing sent him toppling over the side of the ship into the water below. Bryna cast an appreciative glance at the priestess beside her. Carolyn’s skill with the staff was impressive; Bryna had always considered hers nothing more than an extra source of magical power.
Raynn grunted in pain, and Carolyn’s attention snapped back to the warrior, returning her focus to healing. Kamery and Elthas had finished off the remaining threat to Bryna’s right, and both were now circling around to tackle those on the other side. With a confirming glance at her new pet monkey, the mage turned her attention to the other side also.
Raynn had managed to rotate the fight, so she now had her back to Bryna and Carolyn, with the Defias between her and the edge of the ship. Her ponytail swayed as she looked back and forth, watching all sides of the battlefield. Bryna’s frost spells flew past her head, as Elthas and Kamery attacked from the flanks. Working in what was becoming a now-familiar unison, the group dispatched the opposition quickly. Raynn turned back to the two incapacitated Defias with a short chuckle.
“How long will that hold?” she asked.
“Not long,” Kamery admitted, and Bryna nodded her agreement. The polymorph spell was a tricky one, easily broken and difficult to maintain.
Raynn nodded and, with a decisive sweep of her shield, broke the fragile spell. The disoriented pirate looked blankly at her for a moment. “Can you swim?” the warrior asked. The pirate nodded, and she smirked. “Good.” Another quick thrust of her shield sent him overboard. A solid kick a moment later dislodged the boarding ramp from the ship.
Kamery roughly shook the final pirate awake, and posed the same question. At his confused nod, he met the same fate, and the group looked around the now-deserted lower deck to appraise their situation.
Elthas padded up and shifted out of feline form to speak. “There’s a ramp up at the back of the ship. There’s only one person up there. I think it’s the captain’s cabin up top.”
Bryna tipped her head back to look at the druid from under the brim of her had. She hadn’t even noticed him leave. The startled reactions of the others reassured her that she hadn’t been the only one.
“Let’s finish this then.” Raynn frowned, as she added, “Then we have to figure out how to destroy this thing.”
“It’s full of explosives.” Elthas looked around the group, taking in their surprise at this fount of information. “I got curious.” Giving Carolyn a pointed look down the length of his nose, he added, “It didn’t kill me.”
Carolyn laughed, and after a moment, the others joined in. Curiosity killed the cat. A Human saying; Carolyn must have told him that one. Bryna remembered her first meeting with the druid, with his rapid questions and his fascination with her magical potential. I wonder how often his curiosity got them into trouble in Kalimdor.
Their hearts and steps momentarily lighter, the group followed Elthas’s lead, the druid prowling ahead of them in feline form. True to his word, they soon found the ramp leading upwards, and mounted to the upper deck.
As they reached the top of the ramp, Bryna noted that she and Carolyn appeared to be the only ones with Raynn, who was in the lead. The other two had slipped back into the shadows again, but she knew that they were taking strategic positions to strike from hiding when needed.
Their confident approach was shattered by a twang from above, followed swiftly by an arrow striking Carolyn in the shoulder. She hissed in pain, as her body twisted with the impact. Reacting quickly, Raynn moved in front of the priestess, her shield raised.
Left unprotected, Bryna swiftly raised a shield of frost around herself, chilling the air. Her instinctive reaction paid off, as a second arrow struck against the icy barrier, weakening it. The angle of attack was high, from above, she realized. Tilting her head to look from below the wide brim of her hat, she began to gather frost in her hands.
With a grimace, Carolyn raised her own barrier, and, a moment later, one around Raynn.
A wiry man in black leather and red bandanna stood atop the cabin’s roof, a longbow in his hand, fitting another arrow. Bryna unleashed the frost-bolt. Dropping the bow VanCleef agilely leaped off of the roof to disappear into the shadows below.
 Raynn’s ponytail swayed as she looked back and forth, trying to spot the Defias rogue. Behind her, Carolyn whispered a third spell in succession, and the tightness on her face eased.

            <Text>The journey to Feathermoon Stronghold proved to be both challenging and enlightening for Carolyn and Elthas. The rumors of trouble had not been exaggerated, and they found themselves deeply involved in addressing the issues plaguing the stronghold.

Meanwhile, Kamery delved into the mysteries of the Badlands, navigating the treacherous terrain and confronting the threats that lurked there. As an operative of SI:7, she skillfully gathered intelligence while dealing with the dangers that unfolded.

In Theramore, Bryna's time with Jaina Proudmoore was fruitful, but her growing restlessness couldn't be ignored. The desire for adventure beckoned, and she yearned to reunite with the camaraderie of her fellow adventurers.

As whispers of trouble reached the graceful boughs of Darnassus, Carolyn and Elthas found themselves drawn to Feathermoon Stronghold. The shimmering waters of the Veiled Sea reflected the moon's glow as the Kaldorei and their human companion sailed to the island sanctuary.

Meanwhile, Kamery, following Mathias Shaw's directives, ventured into the arid landscapes of the Badlands. The scorching winds carried whispers of nefarious activities, and Kamery delved into the heart of the mystery, her SI:7 skills honed by years of clandestine operations.

Bryna, nestled within Theramore's arcane embrace, studied under the watchful eye of Jaina Proudmoore. Yet, the pull of adventure tugged at her, and as she roamed the cobbled streets, she felt a restlessness settling in.

Raynn strolled into Theramore, the memories of her brief stay during her recovery in Felwood flooding back. She had been just a young adventurer then, nursing injuries and seeking refuge during the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Jaina Proudmoore had been a guiding light, a friend-like figure who had encouraged Raynn to explore her heritage in Stormwind.

Approaching Jaina's quarters, Raynn couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude. Jaina was the first positive human encounter outside of her parents, and her impact on Raynn's life was immeasurable.

As she entered, the familiarity of the surroundings enveloped her. Jaina looked up from her studies, a warm smile crossing her face.

&quot;Raynn! It's been a while. How have you been?&quot; Jaina welcomed her.

Raynn returned the smile. &quot;I've been well, Jaina. I'm heading to Tanaris to train with a master blacksmith. I wanted to stop by and say hello.&quot;

Jaina's eyes sparkled with understanding. &quot;Ah, pursuing your blacksmithing skills. That's commendable. Always remember, the path to self-discovery is as important as honing your craft.&quot;

As they chatted, Bryna, who had been enjoying the sea breeze near the mage tower, noticed Raynn and approached them. Intrigued by the prospect of joining the duo on their journey, she greeted Raynn with a confident grin.

&quot;Raynn, right?&quot; Bryna asked, checking her memory of the warrior she had met briefly. &quot;Mind if I tag along? I'm in need of some excitement, and your travels seem like just the thing I'm looking for.&quot;

Raynn considered Bryna's request and then chuckled. &quot;Well, I'm heading to Tanaris to train with a master blacksmith. It might not be the most thrilling adventure, but you're welcome to join. Just fair warning, it'll involve a lot of hammering and crafting.&quot;

Bryna's eyes lit up with enthusiasm. &quot;Crafting can be an adventure of its own! Count me in.&quot;

And so, with Jaina's encouraging smile and Bryna's newfound excitement, the trio set forth on their journey, bound for Tanaris and whatever crafting adventures awaited them.</Text>
